<tr><td colspan="2">Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... er... oh! I didn't see you there. Hello."<br/>
<b>You say, "Who are you?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Er... um... oh yes. My name is Denethrir; I am a scholar studying these ancient ruins."<br/>
<b>You say, "Isn't that dangerous? There are monsters everywhere!"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Uh... danger? Oh! Yes. Well, no. The monsters, you see, they don't come up here from the dungeons or down from the tower above, so, there's no monsters on this floor at all! This I learned shortly after I arrived here from Neopia City... These ruins here have stood for centuries, but no one has ever ventured out to see what they were about. Yes. Hmm. I decided to come visit, to see if anything could be learned. So I stepped into the dungeons, but various undead creatures attacked me, and I fled upward instead. Now there are monsters on the ground floor, so I can't really leave. But that's fine, because there's plenty of books and papers here, magically preserved somehow, that I can spend years studying. I have even learned the ancient secrets of the Gaia Wands!"<br/>
<b>You say, "What are the Gaia Wands?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "The Gaia Wands were a type of magical weapon devised by the inhabitans of these ruins, ages ago... there were five kinds of Gaia Wand, but all of them have been long since destroyed. But I have devised... I think... devised a system for recreating these wands. The Volcano, Glacier, Storm, Mountain, and Nature wands are very powerful, and I would be intrigued to see what they are like."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need to make a Volcano Wand?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... hrm. Let me look at my books... ah yes. The Volcano Wand would -- it's for Fire Magic, by the way -- well, the exact components can't be acquired, as the beasts that provided them died out long ago. But you could get close enough by bringing me the armoured stinger from a scorpion, a noil's mane, a gauntlet from one of those enraged jungle warrior types, a glowing stone, and... well, all it says about the last item is, `The mystical staff known as Ni-tas.' How odd."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need to make a Glacier Wand?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... hrm. Let me look at my books... ah yes. The Glacier Wand needs -- it's for Ice Magic, by the way -- well, the exact components can't be acquired, as the beasts that provided them died out long ago. But you could get close enough by bringing me a spirit totem, which is something a shaman would use; the fang of a skeith, a pair of vambraces from one of those enraged jungle warrior types, a glowing stone, and... well, all it says about the last item is, `The mystical staff known as Ni-tas.' How odd."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need to make a Storm Wand?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... hrm. Let me look at my books... ah yes. The Storm Wand, it -- it's for Shock Magic, by the way -- that is... well, the exact components can't be acquired, as the beasts that provided them died out long ago. But you could get close enough by bringing me a killer buzz wing, the discarded skin of a wadjet, a breastplate from one of those enraged jungle warrior types, a glowing stone, and... well, all it says about the last item is, `The mystical staff known as Ni-tas.' How odd."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need to make a Mountain Wand?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... hrm. Let me look at my books... ah yes. The Mountain Wand would -- it's for Spectral Magic, by the way -- well, the exact components can't be acquired, as the beasts that provided them died out long ago. But you could get close enough by bringing me a scorpion's chitinous carapace, one of those wooden shields the elder shamen use, a helm from one of those enraged jungle warrior types, a glowing stone, and... well, all it says about the last item is, `The mystical staff known as Ni-tas.' How odd."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need to make a Nature Wand?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Um... hrm. Let me look at my books... ah yes. The Nature Wand would -- it's for Life Magic, by the way -- well, the exact components can't be acquired, as the beasts that provided them died out long ago. But you could get close enough by bringing me the claw of one of those vicious jungle beasts, the tooth of a noil -- oh my, that sounds dangerous -- a set of shoulder pauldrons from one of those enraged jungle warrior types, a glowing stone, and... well, all it says about the last item is, `The mystical staff known as Ni-tas.' How odd."<br/>
<b>You say, "What else do you know about these ruins?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Well... they are ancient. I know that much. Possibly going back as far as the Great Empire, ruled by the Circle of Twelve. But I haven't been able to tell whether these ruins were actually a part of the Great Empire or not. The tomes on this floor are mostly scientific works, more focused on biology than anything else actually; I haven't found anything about history, or culture, or language. It's possible there are other people who know more about these ruins than I do, but I don't know where you'd find them -- surely they couldn't survive amongst all those monsters in the dungeons!"<br/>
"At any rate, I don't know if you'd even be able to explore up above. I did, once... I came to a locked door that I couldn't open, and I couldn't find a key up here. And I read in a journal that I found that there are three locked doors, so you'll need to find three separate keys to get through them! I think the keys are down in the dungeons. You should go back down there and look for them."<br/>
<b>You say, "Do you know anything about this medallion I found?"</b><br/>
Denethrir the Scholar says, "Medallion? Oh, let me see... hmm... very interesting. Some of the symbols on it are recognizable, but I can't really decipher it. And it doesn't look familiar; I don't think it matches the description of any artifacts I've read about. Perhaps you should take this to Eleus Batrin in Neopia City. He might have a better idea what it is."</td></tr>
