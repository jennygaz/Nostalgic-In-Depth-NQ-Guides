<tr><td colspan="2">The undead merchant says, "I can't believe it! Someone who's not undead! You wouldn't believe how cheap undead people are. Every person in this city is a boring old undead fiend... and most of them are bloodthirsty, to boot."<br/>
<br/>
Say, Who are you?"<br/>
<br/>
The undead merchant says, "Oh, my apologies, I should introduce myself. I am... er... that is... my name is..." The undead merchant scratches his head. "Now that's funny. After all this time, I can't seem to remember my name. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when you've been undead for hundreds of years. At least I fared better than most of the people in this city."<br/>
<br/>
Say, "What happened to the city?"<br/>
<br/>
The undead merchant says, "Well, ages past, it was right next to an oasis, which I guess has dried up. The city became abandoned, then, having no source for water. I lived and died here before that ever happened, though. Imagine my surprise when I found myself awaking, then, and clawing my way out of my grave! It seems an evil wizard had resurrected all the corpses in the city for his own nefarious deeds. I wasn't interested in fighting in his army, though, so I hid away. When the king's wizards came to destroy him, it was an awful battle... but I stayed hidden, so I survived. So to speak. I've just been biding my time here, ever since. I'm not really even much of a merchant, any more. I don't have anything much to sell except for healing potions... and the rarity of potion reagents in the middle of the desert keeps my prices high, not to mention my insatiable undead greed." He shakes his head. "Imagine what my father would say if he could see me now. An undead potion merchant! How bizarre, eh?"</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">The undead merchant says, "All I've got is healing potions, and they're pretty expensive. Not that I have much use for gold out here, but I'm not about to give up my mercantilist principles just because I live alone in abandoned ruins in the middle of a desert, no sir!"
