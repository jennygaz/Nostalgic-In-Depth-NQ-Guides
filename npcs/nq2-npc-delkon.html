<tr><td colspan="2">Delkon says, "Yar! Welcome to our little town o' Seaside, where ye can find the freshest fish on this side o' Meridell. I be a fisherman, meself, though mostly I fish fer the relaxation aspect. Ahoy, ye scurvy dog."<br/>
<b>You say, "Uthare said to ask you about the troubles."</b><br/>
Delkon says, "Yar, did he now? Well, I suppose I be the resident authority on such things, though it pains me to think of them. Yar. Well, it seems that the king's advisor has overthrown him, and locked him away in some ruddy dungeon somewhere. I be not envying the king now, you can wager a brick of gold against a rotten fish on that." <br/>
<b>You say, "What do you know about the advisor?"</b><br/>
Delkon says, "Avast, well, seems this advisor, Ramtor, was long a loyal advisor to the king, but of late he decided that power was more his style. I don't think he's killed the king, though no one's seen the old lad in weeks now. But it was about that same time that Ramtor laid his curse upon the land, and that's why we've got all these ruddy animals going berserk in the wilds." <br/>
<b>You say, "How do you know so much about all this?"</b><br/>
<br/>
Delkon spits on the floor and says, "Yar, just 'cause I be talkin' like a pirate, ye think I'm blind to the world? I did be visitin' the royal castle before the troubles started, and I did see a mad glint in that Ramtor's eye. I wouldn't want to go up against him, but I'd bet there are some who could." He raises an eyebrow at you. "Anyway, rumors and news do travel, and we be not very far from the castle. I keep track of the news, so that the others in town don't have to burden themselves." </td></tr>
