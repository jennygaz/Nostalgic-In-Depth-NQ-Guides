<tr><td colspan="2">Count Sadath runs his hand through his hair and releases a pent-up sigh of relief. "Well, I can't say I've ever been happier to see a commoner," he says. "I don't know what you did to get rid of that dreadful villain Ramtor, but I'm certainly thankful. We all are, I'm sure."<br/>
<b>You say, "What happened here?"</b><br/>
Count Sadath says, "Well, a few weeks ago, Ramtor somehow got the castle guards to take the king prisoner. I suppose he had already cast a spell upon the guards to make them do his bidding. Anyway, I don't know where they took the king. After the king was gone and Ramtor announced that he was now king, we all started to feel unnaturally frightened. Frightened, and... well... sleepy. I suppose it was another spell of Ramtor's, but it seems to have been dispelled by Ramtor's disappearance." <br/>
<b>You say, "Where is Ramtor now?"</b><br/>
Count Sadath says, "I'm afraid I don't know. I can't imagine he'll have gone far, if he'll try to take the throne again as I suspect. He may have fled to the west, an area which has long been uninhabited... mostly. It would be easy for him to go about his business there, without much notice." </td></tr>
