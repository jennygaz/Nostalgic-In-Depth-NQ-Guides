<tr><td colspan="2">Kijandri stares at the tranquil pool in front of her. She finally notices you, and turns a pleasant smile your way. "Ah, you must be the adventurer I've been hearing about. Seeking the lost city, as I understand it."<br/>
<b>You say, "So it seems. What do you know about the lost city?"</b><br/>
Kijandri says, "Not much is known about the lost city, but I'll tell you what I do know. And this isn't myth or rumor; this is fact. The lost city was built at an oasis in the desert, a place of water and trees. But it grew too large, and eventually became abandoned. Years later, a wizard took up residence there, and his evil experiments raised the late citizens into an undead army that he wanted to use for rebellion. The king's wizards came to suppress the rebel wizard, and during the furious battle between them, they conjured a tremendous sandstorm which suffocated everyone involved. It buried the city, and covered all tracks to the place. This was long ago, of course, when the desert was much smaller. After that, nobody cared much about the city. It was lost to history, and as the desert grew over time -- I don't know why it did that -- eventually, memory of how to reach the city was also lost." <br/>
<b>You say, "How do you know all this?"</b><br/>
Kijandri says, "Ah, the old hermit, Potraddo. He was once a historian and -- some say -- a powerful wizard. But he went mad some time ago. I used to take long walks through the forest, and ran into him a few times. He told me some stories, during his saner periods. That was one of them. I don't know where he lives now, though. No one's seen him in years." She shakes her head. "Nobody else believes the stories, though, but I checked. I went to the king's castle, far to the south, and looked in the ancient royal records. The details were sketchier than Potraddo's, but they confirmed it. This was a while ago, though. The journey is too dangerous to make, now, and no one else is really interested in trying."<br/>
<br/>
Kijandri says, "I am glad you found Potraddo and were able to speak to him. He is quite wise. I hope you're able to find out what's going on with the world, and put a stop to it! I guess the lost city is your first stop."<br/>
