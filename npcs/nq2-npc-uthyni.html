<b>You say, "What can you tell me about this town?"</b><br/>
Uthyni says, "Ahoy, ye be wantin' to know about the town? Then go talk to Berig... his house be just to the west. He be fascinated by numbers and statistics, although I do be findin' that very unbecoming of piratical folk. Yar." <br/>
<b>You say, "Tell me about this town."</b><br/>
Uthare says, "Avast, this be a lovely place ta live, if I do say so myself. Plenty o' fresh sea air, more sticks than you kin shake a fish at, and neighbors who'll leave ye ta yer business, if ye be catchin' me drift. Although, lately, there be many strange folk passin' through the area. Probably something ta do with the troubles down 'round the castle way. Arrr." <br/>
<b>You say, "What do you know about the troubles at the castle?"</b><br/>
Uthyni says, "Avast, ye be wantin' ta talk to Delkon if ye haven't already. I know little compared to he. Although..." <br/>
<b>You say, "Yes?"</b><br/>
Uthyni says, "Arr, well, ye see, I heard a rumor, but Delkon wouldn't believe it. The rumor said that the usurper, Ramtor, was going to..." He looks around surreptitiously, as if afraid that someone will overhear. "Yar. It says that Ramtor was going to ban the sale of fish! Yar! Can ye believe it? How can we be makin' a livin' if he be banning our main export?" <br/>
<b>You say, "I'm sorry to hear that. I'll see what I can do about him."</b><br/>
Uthyni says, "Avast, be that true? Arrr! I be cheerin' ye on in yer adventure, then. Ahoy, tell that scurvy brother of mine, Uthare, that ye be havin' me personal recommendation. He'll be givin' ya a discount at his shop fer that. Yar." <br/>
You slowly edge away from Uthyni.<br/>
Uthyni shakes his head sadly as you move away. He doesn't seem to notice. "Yar, what the world be comin' to these days..." </td></tr>
