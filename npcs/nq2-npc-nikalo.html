<tr><td colspan="2">Nikalo says, "You surely have many questions about our town. I will try to answer what I can." <br/>
<b>You say, "Can you tell me about the town?"</b><br/>
Nikalo says, "The town is small and peaceful. The angry creatures of the forest have not come here so far, and with our continued vigilance, they will not. Our citizens are worried, of course, and we would all like to know what's going on." <br/>
<b>You say, "Do you know where I can find the old hermit?"</b><br/>
Nikalo says, "The hermit?" He glances at the other elders, who look worried. "The hermit... he lives near here. To the northwest, in fact, not far outside of town. You'll have to wend your way through some fairly dense underbrush to reach him... and he may not be particularly hospitable if you do. He's gone quite mad, you see." <br/>
<b>You say, "What can you tell me about the surrounding area?"</b><br/>
Nikalo says, "The Eye of Meridell is an ancient formation. The first people to find this area found it calm and peaceful, isolated from the troubles of the world by the ring of mountains surrounding it. They settled here on the edge of the beautiful lake. Back then, the desert to the southeast was much smaller than it is now. Most of it was plains and grassland. But over time, the desert crept ever northward, eventually reaching its current limit. Creatures still live there, though, and in contrast to the animals of the plains, which were peaceable until recently, the desert's inhabitants were always aggressive." </td></tr>
