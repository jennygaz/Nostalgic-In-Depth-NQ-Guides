<tr><td colspan="2">Pongoras says, "The monsters that have been roaming the countryside won't come too close to towns, but there's a cave to the north of here that has all sorts of fiends inside. I wouldn't go there, if I were you. At any rate, if you're going to be out adventuring, I'd recommend staying right near town until you've gained some experience."<br/>
<b>You say, "What can you tell me about the cave?"</b><br/>
Pongoras says, "The cave? I think it used to be a mine of some kind, but it's been abandoned since before I was born. I don't think anyone has been in there in years, but with all the monsters infesting it now, I can't imagine that anyone would want to go there!"<br/>
<b>You say, "What else is near the village?"</b><br/>
Pongoras says, "Well, there's the mountains to the north, and the coastline all around... if you head northeast and then south, you'll get to the city of White River. You can't trust city folk, though. Be careful if you go there."<br/>
<br/>
Pongoras says, "So, it was an old gold mine, eh? I wonder why it got so infested with undead miners... Well, at any rate, I'm glad you cleared it out."</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">Pongoras says, "Well, I once learned to make a couple of simple magic potions from a wandering wizard. If you want, I can sell you a basic healing vial or a dangerous Flare potion. Careful with the Flare potions -- they're quite explosive! I'll just charge you what it costs me to make the potions; anything more wouldn't be fair, since I've known you your whole life."<br/><br/><span class="small">Note that prices are 30% higher on Evil, and 60% higher on Insane difficulty.</span></td></tr>
