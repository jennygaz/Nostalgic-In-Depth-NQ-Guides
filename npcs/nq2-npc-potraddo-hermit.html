<tr><td colspan="2">Potraddo says, "Well, hello there! I don't get many visitors out here... ah, in fact, I don't think I've ever had any visitors out here. Oh well! That's what I get for living in the woods by myself, eh?" <br/>
<b>You say, "Tell me about the lost city."</b><br/>
Potraddo's eyes narrow when he hears your request. "So, you want to know about the lost city of Phorofor, eh? Well, that's a story not many are eager to know the truth of. Have you spoken to Kijandri about me?" <br/>
<b>You say, "No, I didn't."</b><br/>
Potraddo says, "Ah, well, she is a smart girl. Talk to her if you get a chance. But you are more interested in learning about Phorofor, no doubt, so pay attention, and I will tell you what you need to know." (or)<br/>
<b>You say, "Yes, I did."</b><br/>
Potraddo nods. "Indeed, she is a wise girl, wiser than the so-called 'Council of Elders' here in Lakeside. They think I'm mad, simply because I shun the company of most people. In truth, I have always felt more comfortable with nature than with people. Nature never makes demands of you; it simply exists, on its own terms. But you are interested in learning about Phorofor... so I will tell you what you need to know." <br/>
<b>You say, "Go on."</b><br/>
Potraddo lets out a long breath, then begins. "I will trust you with this information because you seem to me to be strong of spirit, and noble of purpose. I trust that you will not make malicious use of the information I am about to give you. Phorofor now harbors legions of undead, who continually rise and rise again from the souls of the departed. It is a very dangerous place and I would not travel there... but I believe you must do so, because all the bridges leading to the eastern part of the continent have been destroyed, and within the city lies the only way to travel to the east." <br/>
<b>You say, "Why do I need to travel to the east?"</b><br/>
Potraddo says, "A shadow has come over this land, as you are no doubt aware. Beasts have become hostile, monsters have arisen... but the cause of this has not been widely known. The king's advisor, Ramtor, has overthrown him and taken power. I suspect, though I cannot prove, that he has cast powerful, evil spells upon the land, in order to keep everyone occupied -- they cannot return their king to power while they must continually fight off angry monsters. This is a heavy burden, but I think that it must be you who travels to the royal castle and confronts Ramtor. But to do that, you must first pass through Phorofor. There is an Orb of Travel within the city, that will take you to the east. I do not know precisely where it will deposit you, however, but be prepared for any danger. But entering the city is not as easy as it sounds." <br/>
<b>You say, "How do I enter the city?"</b><br/>
Potraddo says, "The entrance to the city is blocked, but it can be opened by means of a magical passphrase." He pauses for a moment. "The phrase is, 'ad ro un ta en.' Speak this phrase to the city's guardian, and you will be granted entrance." He stops, and sighs. "That is all I can tell you for now. You must do the rest yourself. My thoughts will be with you, though. Take care in the wilds." </td></tr>
