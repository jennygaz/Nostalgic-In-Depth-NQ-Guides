<b>You say, "My name is Atreju."</b><br/>
Erick says, "Oh... uh... well hello... I'm glad you found me... I don't suppose you'd be willing to help an old wizard, would you?"<br/>
<b>You say, "What kind of help?"</b><br/>
Erick says, "Uh... well... ages ago... when this place was... was attacked, in a terrible battle... they put a shield over this place, trapping the inhabitants... we cannot escape... uh... perhaps... perhaps you could find something for me... I could escape if I had it... please... please help..."<br/>
<b>You say, "What do you need me to find?"</b><br/>
Erick says, "Need... I need... a carved oaken staff... from the giants who roam the plains to the south of the Desert of Roo. And... and a headpiece... one of the Jewels of Power, to... to sit atop the staff... and one last thing. An ancient artifact... the Coruscating Gem... to focus the power and create the final... the final staff. Seek the archmagus here... he has... he has the gem."<br/>
<b>You say, "What are the Jewels of Power?"</b><br/>
Erick says, "The Jewels... the Jewels of Power are... are lost to time. But there is one who knows... who can tell you about them. Seek out Leirobas, to the north..."<br/>
Erick says, "Eh? Who's that? Who's there?"<br/>
<b>You say, "Do you recognize this clouded gem?"</b><br/>
Erick says, "I do... I do... it is the Coruscating Gem, but it has been... been damaged. Give it... to me... and I will... cleanse it."<br/>
You attempted to give Erick the following items: clouded gem<br/>
Erick takes the gem from you and passes his hand over it, while muttering something softly. The gem instantly clears, vibrant light shining from its depths and illuminating the cave. "This is the Coruscating Gem," he says hoarsely, and hands it back to you. Erick gave you the CORUSCATING GEM!</td></tr>
