<tr><td colspan="2">Mipsy says, "Oh, you startled me! I'm sorry, I'm a bit jittery these days, what with all the fuss from the bridge being stuck. I'm glad it's opened up now, though, and I've heard it's all thanks to you!"<br/>
<b>You say, "What can you tell me about this town?"</b><br/>
Mipsy says, "Oh, I don't know very much about White River. I haven't lived here very long, you see; in fact, I'd only just moved in when the wizard attacked and got the bridge stuck. So I haven't even met most of the people who live here, since they've been trapped across the river." <br/>
<b>You say, "What do you do?"</b><br/>
Mipsy says, "Well, I'm a wizard, as you may have guessed from my robe. Not a very good one, mind you... I only know a few simple spells and other tricks." <br/>
<b>You say, "Would you like to join me in adventuring?"</b><br/>
<br/>
Mipsy says, "Me?? You want me to join you?" Mipsy jumps up from her chair excitedly. "Of course! Of course! I've already got my handy wizard's wand and my robes, and that's all I'll really need for a life of adventure, isn't it? Let's get going!" <br/>
Mipsy has joined your party!</td></tr>
