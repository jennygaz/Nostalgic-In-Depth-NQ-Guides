<tr><td colspan="2">Horxas says, "Welcome to my tavern! Although it's not much of a tavern these days, what with the bridge and all... We can't even get any ale. So there's not really anything to drink. But if you want a room for the night, it'll be 35 gold pieces."<br/>
<b>You say, "What can you tell me about this town?"</b><br/>
Horxas says, "White River's a peaceful town. The bit with the wizard showing up was more excitement than we've seen in all my lifetime! Normally, we just have a few wizards who quietly practice their magics, and the tradesmen who pass through frequently. They ship all manner of goods through here, although business has dried up a bit, now that the bridge is unusable."<br/>
<br/>
(after defeating Zombom:)<br/>
Horxas says, "Oh, thank you for defeating that horrible wizard! Now the bridge is usable again, and we're finally able to get shipments of ale! My customers will be so happy! Since you defeated him, I'll let you rent a room at a discounted rate, only 25 gold pieces." </td></tr>
