<p>Boss or Unique monsters are found in the lists below. They're split up by chapters - just click on the chapter in the navigation bar below to view its bosses.</p>
<p>NQ2 "Boss" monsters do not have a fixed experience boost - hence you might get a different result than show below. This is not a mistake in the guide. This information, if recorded, is based on personal expirience - you might get a different bonus for defeating the boss.</p>
<p><i>Victory Speech</i> is said when the boss defeats you, <i>Defeat speech</i> is said when you defeat the boss.</p>

Hit Points: 500 (625 on evil; 750 on insane).<br/>Special: Rampant Acceleration (38% Haste), Infestation (44 group damage), Dormancy (44% slow). Immune to Mipsy's slow.<br/>Loot: Celestial Talisman, 2 weapon/armor items, 600 neopoints.<br/>
<br/><span class="small">Opening Speech: Siliclast, a stout rock golem, looks at you balefully as you approach. He says nothing, but a deep rumbling sound emanates from him as he prepares to strike!<br/>
<br/>
Flee Speech: Siliclast stares after you, unmoving, as you flee!<br/>
<br/>
Victory Speech: Siliclast's eyes dim a little as you fall to the ground. He says nothing, but stares at you, motionless, as darkness takes you...<br/>
<br/>
Defeat Speech: Siliclast shudders, and after a moment pieces of his stone body start flaking off. Seconds later, he begins to rumble even louder, and larger pieces crumble to the ground. After a few seconds he is nothing more than a pile of rubble. In the middle of the pile, you see a dull gleam -- the Celestial Talisman!</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3040_0f9ec.gif" alt="Gebarn II"/></td><td><b>Gebarn II</b><br/>
Location: Ruined Temple, Level 4 (<a href="../maps/nq2-ruined-temple-level-4.html">View Map</a>).<br/>
Hit Points: 350 (437 on evil; 525 on insane).<br/>Special: Contagion (52 group damage), Hibernation (53% slow), Restore (Heal 100hp), Destroy (77 direct damage).<br/>Loot: 2 weapon/armor items, upper part of the Medallion of Wind, 700 neopoints.<br/>
<br/><span class="small">Opening Speech: Gebarn II, an ancient undead pharaoh, stands before you, a powerful reanimation of his former self. &quot;I have been charged with protecting the Medallion of Wind from you!&quot; he shouts. &quot;And I will not falter in my duty!&quot; He attacks!<br/>
<br/>
Flee Speech: Gebarn shouts, &quot;The Medallion will remain safely mine, forever! Flee, and do not return, cowards!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Victory Speech: Gebarn nods, satisfied, as you collapse to the floor. &quot;I have done my duty, and will do so, evermore...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Defeat Speech: Gebarn roars in anguish. &quot;You don't know what you've done!&quot; he gasps. &quot;The Medallion must not be... it must not be reunited!&quot; Suddenly, powerful blasts of energy emit from his body in all directions, shaking the ruined temple and raining debris everywhere. You dive for cover, and Gebarn's body explodes in a tremendous conflagration. The ground shakes, like a great earthquake. After a minute, though, it ends, and the room is silent. Lying on the floor where Gebarn stood, you now see a piece of bronze metal, glinting in the fading light.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3080_10cae.gif" alt="Revenant"/></td><td><b>Revenant</b><br/>
Location: Palace of Ancient Kings, Level 2 (<a href="../maps/nq2-palace-of-ancient-kings-level-2.html">View Map</a>).<br/>
Hit Points: 600 (750 on evil; 900 on insane).<br/>Special: Mitigation (group heal 60hp), 38% haste, shockwave, Spellbind (mesmerize), Infestation (44 group damage). Immune to Talinia's slowing strike.<br/>Loot: 2 armor/weapon items, 750 neopoints.<br/>
<br/><span class="small"><b>Note:</b> He's coupled with two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201207190114/http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3085_e937e.gif" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">possessed skeletons</a> (180 hp each). They'll die automatically if he's defeated, though (it may or may not make sense to not attack them at all).<br/>
<br/>
Opening Speech: You see a decaying, mummified figure before you--but despite its state, it appears fierce and powerful. Its mouth is covered by rotting cloth, but it makes a ghastly moaning sound as it moves to attack!<br/>
<br/>
Flee speech: The Revenant waves its arms in frustration as you flee from the fight!<br/>
<br/>
Defeat Speech: The Revenant shudders and falls to its knees as the final blow lands. A thin keening sound emits from its lifeless husk as it collapses to the ground. Behind it, you see two passages--one that leads to a glowing orb, and another that leads to a calm, but somewhat disheveled young woman.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3120_e3008.gif" alt="Coltzan's ghost"/></td><td><b>Coltzan's ghost</b><br/>

<br/><span class="small">Opening Speech: Coltzan's ghost looks at you sadly. &quot;It is not my will--but you must die!&quot; He attacks!<br/>
<br/>
Flee Speech: Coltzan does not follow as you flee. &quot;I suppose we must continue this later. I will wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: Coltzan's ghost withdraws from the fight, then suddenly he becomes more solid, more real... but still a spirit. &quot;Thank you for releasing me from that evil grip,&quot; he says. &quot;Come, we have much to talk about.&quot;</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3140_8a979.gif" alt="Anubits"/></td><td><b>Anubits</b><br/>
