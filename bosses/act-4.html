<p>Boss or Unique monsters are found in the lists below. They're split up by chapters - just click on the chapter in the navigation bar below to view its bosses.</p>
<p>NQ2 "Boss" monsters do not have a fixed experience boost - hence you might get a different result than show below. This is not a mistake in the guide. This information, if recorded, is based on personal expirience - you might get a different bonus for defeating the boss.</p>
<p><i>Victory Speech</i> is said when the boss defeats you, <i>Defeat speech</i> is said when you defeat the boss.</p>

<br/>
Flee Speech: Meuka laughs and spits more goo at you as you run away. &quot;Ha ha ha, you're no better than pond scum!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Defeat Speech: Meuka explodes into a shower of sickening green goo as the last strike lands. You spend a few minutes wiping his remains off yourself... and the floor... and the walls... and the ceiling. Count von Roo, who managed to avoid getting drenched, raises an eyebrow at you as you approach him.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4045_92d47.gif" alt="Spider Grundo"/></td><td><b>Spider Grundo</b><br/>

Flee Speech: Spider Grundo laughs as you flee.<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: Spider Grundo is flung against the far wall of the cave as the last blow hits. He looks dazed as he picks himself up, but shakes it off. However, the fire has gone out of his eyes. He tries to speak, but only incomprehensible mumbles emerge</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4100_993cd.gif" alt="Hubrid Nox"/></td><td><b>Hubrid Nox</b><br/>

Victory Speech: Hubrid Nox relaxes as you fall to the ground in pain. &quot;I am undefeatable in my fortress!&quot; he says, as the blackness takes you...<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: Hubrid Nox is forced to one knee by the final strike. He struggles for a moment, then stands up, unsteady. His expression has changed, now, and he lowers his hands, no longer intent on attacking.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4070_7a6d7.gif" alt="Dark Faerie"/></td><td><b>Dark Faerie</b><br/>

<br/><span class="small">(you fight all four at once)<br/>
Opening speech: The Faeries gaze at you as you approach. You shout, &quot;Zhadramekel!&quot; and the Faeries start screaming in terror, as if burned. Suddenly, they each grow to twenty times their normal size. They're now as big as you are... and they're attacking!<br/>
<br/>
Flee speech: The Faeries shrink back down to their normal size as you run away. &quot;Balthazar is ours!&quot; they scream in unison.<br/>
<br/>
Victory speech: The faeries shrink back to their normal size. &quot;You were a fool to try and defeat us!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: The Faeries each shrink to their normal size as they die, and suddenly their tiny bodies all vanish in an eyeblink. Balthazar shakes his head and sniffs the air, as the trees around you begin to change and wither. Within moments, Balthazar's grove has become its normal, evil self, no longer enchanted by happiness.</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4071_e05d3.gif" alt="Fire Faerie"/></td><td><b>Fire Faerie</b><br/>
