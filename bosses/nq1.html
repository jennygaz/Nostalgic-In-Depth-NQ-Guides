	<p>Want to know who you face before you attack them? Those are the [almost] ultimately evil bosses in NeoQuest.</p>
	<p>As a general rule, be at least 2 levels above the level of the boss you're fighting - should give you a much easier time with them (this will not work on UBGs... but then, who said they would be easy on you ?)</p><table width="90%" class="t1" align="center" style="background: white" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><th>Image</th><th>Boss Information</th></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq/m/400019_zBNtr_XantantheFoul.gif" alt="Xantan The Foul"/></td><td><b>Xantan The Foul</b><br/>

&quot;I'll teach you to come here, fool!&quot; he shouts as he raises his wand and prepares to attack.<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: Xantan the Foul roars a word less howl of anguish as he falls, defeated. The walls begin to shake suddenly, and bits of stone and rock tumble from the ceiling, clattering on the ground all around you. A few large stones fall, nearly crushing you. The rumbling sound grows as the room shakes more and more violently. Xantan appears to be wasting away before your very eyes! His body shrivels, becoming colorless and small, and he emits a whimper just before a flash of white light blinds you momentarily. When your vision clears, Xantan is gone, and you hear a faint whisper in the distance...<br/>

Defeated Speech: Kreai falls to the ground, gasping for air. &quot;I... cannot... cannot be... defeated...&quot; He coughs and looks up at you. &quot;I... I suppose we were foolish... to think we could live forever here... but the others... The others will not be so easily overcome.

<br/>
Defeated speech: Gors the Mighty swings madly at you with his staff, but at the last falls to the ground. He struggles to his feet. &quot;I am impressed,&quot; Gors says. &quot;None have ever bested me in combat before. Though it pains me to admit it, you are a better figher than I.

Defeated Speech: The Archmagus of Roo slumps back against the wall of his tiny chamber. &quot;I never thought anyone could find all the keys... or get to this place. You are truly powerful to have defeated me. Perhaps... perhaps you can bring peace to this place after all.

Defeated Speech: The Guardian of Fire Magic begins to change colour, from red, to orange, and yellow, getting hotter and hotter with each change. Suddenly the Guardian explodes upward into an enormous pillar of flame, shooting into the sky. Your hair is singed as you are hurled backward by the explosion, tumbling through the sand and fetching up against a large rock embedded in the ground. A few moments later, the pillar vanishes, replaced by a cloud of thick, drifting smoke. You make your way back over to where the Guardian was, and see a flame-coloured staff lying on the ground.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq/m/400158_iYhMr_theGuardianofIceMagic.gif" alt="Guardian of Ice Magic"/></td><td><b>Guardian of Ice Magic</b><br/>

Defeated speech: The Guardian of Ice Magic stops moving suddenly, as tiny hairline cracks begin to spiderweb through its body. A few pieces of ice crack and fall from the Guardian, and suddenly it shatters entirely, exploding pieces of ice all over the floor. The ice melts rapidly, forming a pool of chilled water, in the center of which lies a cobalt-blue staff.<br/>

Defeated speech: The Guardian of Shock Magic begins emitting bolts of electricity in all directions, vibrating furiously. Scorch marks appear on the walls where the bolts strike them; you barely dodge behind a pillar as the Guardian explodes in a shower of sparks, electrifying the air -- you feel your hair rise from the static charge, which slowly dissipates. Looking around, you see that where the Guardian stood, there lies now an amber-coloured staff. </span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq/m/400155_AasWK_theGuardianofSpectralMagic.gif" alt="Guardian of Spectral Magic"/></td><td><b>Guardian of Spectral Magic</b><br/>

Defeated Speech: The Guardian of Spectral Magic begins emitting intense beams of white light from its body, holes forming where the beams emerge. You shield your eyes as the blinding beams pass over you, and suddenly the Guardian explodes in a trembling rush of light and energy. After a few minutes, you are able to see again, but purple bars and spots still cloud your vision. However, on the floor in front of you, you see a bone-coloured staff lying on the ground where the Guardian once stood. </span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="background: #FAFAFA; height: 30px">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq/m/400157_qlfCy_theGuardianofLifeMagic.gif" alt="Guardian of Life Magic"/></td><td><b>Guardian of Life Magic</b><br/>

<br/><span class="small">Beginning speech: The Guardian of Life Magic flexes its muscular, rock-carved arms as you approach.<br/>
<br/>
Defeated Speech: The Guardian of Life Magic trembles as the leaves and vines entwining its body begin to wither and die. Bits of rock and dirt and soil fall away, and as the plantlife holding the Guardian together disappears, the earth making up its body begins to crumble and collapse. After a few moments, the Guardian is nothing more than a pile of rock, dirt, and dead leaves lying on the ground.

<br/>
Defeated Speech: Faleinn whines with anger, fear, and hatred, as she falls to the ground, apparently dead. Suddenly you hear shrieks coming from all around you, and you spin around to see hundreds of the undead citizens of Kal Panning keel over, their spirits departing their bodies. All around you, there is a rushing of wind, and a soft glow begins to emit from Faleinn's body; and suddenly Faleinn reappears, a translucent specter of her former self, floating in the air above her corpse.
