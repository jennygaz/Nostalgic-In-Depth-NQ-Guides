<p>You should be <b>Level 5</b>, wielding a basic <b>damage 3
wand</b>, and be equipped with either a set of <b>Cloth Robes</b>
or an <b>Energy Shield</b>.</p>

<p>You should have about <b>20/30 Weak Healing Potions</b> and
have about <b>10/20 Glowing Stones</b>.</p>

<p>Your skill should be something like this, <b>One</b> Point in
Fire Weapons, &gt;Firepower, &gt;Fire Ball, &gt;Wall of Flame,
<b>One</b> Point in Ice Weapons, Heart of Ice, Snowball, Glacier
Strike, and <b>One</b> Point in Life Weapons, Field Medic and
Life Steal. So in summery, One in all the skills of Fire Magic,
One in all the skills of Ice Magic, and One in the first three
skills of Life Magic.</p>

<p><b>A Bit About Potions....</b></p>

<p>When you enter Dank Cave, you will have to use your potion
supply to heal. This is what I stick by. Now, Although you just
have Weak Healing Potions as you enter, after Dank Cave, and a
parts of it, you will get stronger ones. Use the weaker ones
outside the battles if a battle left you with low health, and the
stronger ones in battle. This is because if you are left with low
health in a battle, but have not defeated your opponent, it isn't
very useful to heal a little bit for several rounds when your
opponent is dealing more damage than they heal each round, and
you can also save turns for attacking if you heal in bulk. But
for now, you just have weak healing potions, so use them when Hit
Points are low!</p>

<p><b>To The Dank Cave!</b></p>

<p>Are you in Neopia City? And did the recap match you? If yes,
Good, continue, if no, read Part I <b>now</b>, 'K?</p>

<p>Your hit points should be full, but if not, be sure to use the
magic of Borax, not your potions yet. You need to stock up on
them, you will need them in Dank Cave!</p>

<p>OK! Head north (up) to a stretch of hills, called The Hills Of
Jub. <b>Hunt</b> around here, and collect some more potions and
such. The monsters there should be a piece of cake, but watch out
for <b>Grizzly Bearogs</b>, they're a challenge, as well as the
<b>Dire Lupes</b>, they both should be close to your level with
high hit points.</p>

<p>At about the <b>end of Level 5/ beginning of Level 6</b>, head
for the mouth of the cave. Where it usually says things like,
"You see Eleus Bratin here, <u>Talk to Eleus Bratin</u>" it will
say something like, "You see a cave opening here. <u>Go!</u>".
Click on Go! and enter Dank Cave...</p>

<p><b>The Dank Cave, Level 1</b></p>

<p>On the first level of the cave, you need to initially
<b>Hunt</b> east-ish, then south-ish, because that's the only way
to get to the cave ramp that leads to the next part!! Use the Map
Of Dank Cave, and you should see a clear route. The monsters
aren't to difficult: the third breed of imp, the <b>Cave Imp</b>,
who is only slightly stronger than the Fire and Ice imps, a load
of <b>Cave Slugs</b> roam here, but they're only a little
stronger than the cave imps. The <b>Cave Lupes</b> are stronger,
but at your level and skills, they shouldn't be too difficult...
If you get a Cave Lupe Pelt, keep it, as it will provide part of
some new armour for you, Yay! You don't try to get it yet,
however, as you need more items! And don't go up the Cave Ramp
yet!</p>

<p>Now, you may find the monsters easy, good, because if they
were hard you either 1) haven't followed the guide or 2) You,
well, haven't been paying attention! You don't want them to be
hard and impossible to beat, do you?</p>

<p>When you are about <b>Level 7</b>, your skills should be: One
in all of the Fire Magic Skills, One in all of the Ice Magic
Skills, One in all of the Life Magic Skills, and One in the first
of the Spectral Magic Skills, Spectral Weapons.</p>

<p>At <b>Level 7</b>, you should be near the Cave Ramp. Now you
can take it.</p>

<p><b>The Dank Cave, Level 2</b></p>

<p>Here the monsters jump from levels <b>2-4</b>, <b>to 4-6</b>.
Watch yourself. You should also find that your glacier strike is
getting stronger. Good. Remember to finish the Spectral Magic
Tree, the go on to Shock Magic. The monsters you will encounter
are not too difficult, but watch out for those <b>Broken
Skeletons</b>! The monsters levels are getting close to yours, so
keep potion level high, and Hit Points high. Your Life Skills
should be working hopefully, and remember Spectral and Life work
together like a charm, stopping the damage and healing with it
and normal healing, and countering it really helps. You need to
<b>hunt</b> east (right), then south (down) along the stone. The
soil leading off east from the stone is <b>not</b> a short cut.
It leads to a mass of swampy black stuff, which is impassible.
You have to go down along the stone and left and up again. Why
not talk to Rikti? He has a lot of information on the caves and
Xantan.</p>

<p>Make sure you have enough items, you need things like tiny
garnets, tiny beryl's, tiny ambers, tiny obsidians, tiny lapis's,
etc from the skeletons. This path is long, but not difficult.
Fight around, be at <b>Level 9</b> or <b>10</b> before you go up
those stairs though, Xantan is close!</p>

<p><b>Dank Cave, Level 3- The Dank Cave Maze, Xantan's
Lair</b></p>

<p>Wow! Your nearly up against that Xantan, but you still have a
lot of training first!</p>

<p>Use the Dank Cave Map to <b>Hunt</b> your way, but it involves
a lot of doubling up paths and monsters. Out of all the monsters
on the soil, make sure you find those <b>Metal Devours</b>!
Collect the <b>corroded rods</b> from them, as you will need them
for your new weapon!</p>

<p>Here you may find stronger healing potions than the weak ones,
<b>Standard Healing Potions!</b></p>

<p>Lets take a commercial break to compare the two...</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="2" width="600" summary="Healing Potions Chart" align="center">
<tr bgcolor="silver">
<th width="33%">Name</th>
<th width="33%">Default Healing Power</th>
<th width="33%">Carry amount</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td height="19">A Weaker Healing Potion</td>
<td height="19">10 Health</td>
<td height="19">MAX 30</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>A Standard Healing Potion</td>
<td>30 Health</td>
<td>MAX 20</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>*Cut to Odd Commercial Deep Voice* So as you can see, The
Standard Healing Potion heals <b>Three Times</b> as much damage
as a Weaker Healing Potion, but you can only carry <b>Two
Thirds</b> as many as the Weaker Ones, which means that they're
about twice as good as the Weaker Healing Potions. *End of Odd
Commercial Deep Voice*</p>

<p>Back to the maze!</p>

<p>Ok! If you are not at <b>Xantan's Lair</b> yet (it should say
under the Navigational Panel, and it should be stone underfoot),
Hurry Up!</p>

<p>Make sure to save any <b>Standard Healing Potions</b>.
Although you might only get 3, and you may get 20, save them for
Xantan. I suggest you have around 4 or 5 at least, but it can be
done with none.</p>

<p>You should be at least <b>Level 13</b> after all that hunting,
but <b>hunt</b> around Xantan's Lair to pick up some important
items off the <b>Skeleton Guards</b>, like <b>a Piece of
Glass</b> and a <b>Stretch of Rotting Cloth</b>. They're around
level 9 or 10, have about 50hp. When you have beaten a few of
those skeletons, go up to Xantan. He is that odd slimy thing with
a cape on the map, but make sure that you <b>Heal</b> yourself
before the battle, on the square before him heal to <b>maximum
health</b> with the weak potions.</p>

<p>By this level, you should have One Skill Point in all of the
Fire Skills, One in all of the <font color="#0000FF">Ice</font>
Skills, One in all of the <font color="#A52A2A">Life</font>Skills, One in all of <font color="#00FF00">Spectral</font> Skills and the first three <font color="#FFFF00">Shock</font> Skills have One Point in.</p>

<p><b>Boss One - Xantan The Foul.</b></p>

<p>Make sure you healed yourself like I told you, and then move
straight at him!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622164608im_/http://www.pinkpt.com/idnq/img/mon/boss/xantan.gif" width="96" height="96" alt="Xantan"/></p>

<p><b>Tips</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Xantan can deal out around 20 damage each round. Be safe and
keep your health at least 30.</li>

<li>Use your Glacier Strike, they work well against him.</li>

<li>Use Absorption to heal yourself and stop him attacking
you.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Profile</b>: Xantan has <b>80 Health</b> on Normal. He is
<b>Level 10</b>. He can blast you with <b>fire</b>.</p>

<p>He is not too difficult... at level 13 you should have a bit
of resistance with Fortitude against his fire blasts, and deal a
lot of damage against him. Keep on hammering away, and with your
life skills you should be healing a bit of damage nearly every
turn. Remember my tips, and go and blow 'im to shreds! He should
be a Piece of Cake.</p>

<p>And if you are back, you probably won. Congratulations! You
have just got <b>Five Hundred Experience Points</b>, which should
send you close to Level 14, and <b>Five Hundred NeoPoints</b> to
top it off! Also, you will have your first artifact, if will be
the <b class="art">green</b> thing under the armour list. Make
sure you <b>do not</b> leave the cave until you have at least
<b>one</b> of the first five sets below in the table, and
<b>one</b> of the second two sets below in the second table,
'K?</p>

<p><b>Armour and Weapon Upgrade</b></p>

<p>After defeating Xantan, you should see you are standing where
he was. Walk West (Left), and you should see a blue thing. Walk
on it, and on the Navigation Panel, it tells you it is a Magical
Teleporter. Use it, (<u>Go!</u>) and you will be teleported to
the first Level of the Dank Cave, close to the exit. That was
useful, as we need to exit!</p>

<p><b>Sneak</b> out, because the monsters are too weak for much,
if any, experience. Go to <b>Neopia City</b>, and talk to
<b>Eleus Bratin</b>. Explain that you have defeated Xantan, and
he will tell you about your next destination, <i>The Jungle
Ruins</i>! Also, talk to him and get him to craft you a more
powerful weapon! The options are...</p>

<p>There is no special abilities column because the wands have
<b>NO</b> special powers AT ALL. Because of this, like your other
armour and wand, do NOT get any others, as they are EXACTLY the
same. These are <b>One Stage Up</b> from your other wand, and are
<b>damage 6</b> wands, not damage 3 wands. Watch your damage
multiply!</p>

<p>Next, talk to <b>Coras Tille</b>. She will make you your new
armour! You will need one set of the following...</p>

<p>Give her one of the sets and she will give you a <b>defense
6</b> armour! Yes, to match you damage 6 wand! They don't have
any powers, so, like the wands, no need to get another, 'cause it
is a waste of Glowing Stones.<br/>
<b>Set One</b> makes you a <b>Magic Robe</b>, and <b>Set Two</b>
makes you a <b>Mirrored Force Field</b>.</p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b></p>

<p>Yippee! Your have conquered the Dank Caves, and are now
<b>Level 13</b>, and have grown <b>8 Levels</b> since the start
of the Guide. You should have around <b>15/30</b> Weak Healing
Potions at least, and possibly a few Standard Healing
Potions.</p>

<p><b>Bonus Section! The Jungle Ruins, Part 1!</b></p>

<p>OK! Now you have got through the Dank Caves, I know how
annoying waiting can be, so, Here We Go!</p>

<p>Now, as Eleus suggested, head over to the Jungle Ruins!
<b>Sneak</b> there, as there is the monsters are way to weak. It
is South (Down) of Neopia City. You will see a jungle, go through
there and go to a Ancient Ruin, and enter in.</p>

<p>The monsters on the Ground Floor are way easy. <b>Hunt</b>
through there. You can go forward to the stairs upward a the
north end of the floor to the tower and talk to Denethir on the
first floor, but you can't go further up yet, and you can't do
anything with him yet, so you may want to skip that and go right
to the dungeon levels.</p>

<p>Remember your skills! I suggest after each tree has One Point
in them, go over Ice, then take Spectral again.</p>

<p><b>Hunt</b> around the area around these stairs, and do
<b>not</b> go down the stairs next to the ones leading upward.
After the hunt, at, or close to, <b>Level 14</b>, try heading
further away from the stairs. Don't bother to talk to Margoreth
yet, you can talk to her, just not now, it wastes time and she
will tell you more after you beat your next boss...</p>

<p>Remember, if you are using too many potions,back track! Then
return when you have gained a few Levels.</p>

<p>OK! you should be progressing towards the other side of the
map, check the map section. Go out into Kreai's section.
<b>Hunt</b> around here. Before going to Kreai, bet at <b>Level
16-18</b>, <b>AT LEAST</b>, although it can be done at 17 pretty
easily, I suggest near 18, cause you need to be WAY higher after
him, so it would be better to get Kreai out of the way easily,
and take the others on at an OK level. Once you are <b>Level
18</b> your skills should be: <b>One Skill Point</b> in all Fire,
Shock, Spectral, and Life Trees, and two points in all skills in
the Ice Tree.</p>

<p>You should have collected a lot of potions, quite possible
maximum, Mainly Standard with some Weak ones. Remember what I
said about them!</p>

<p>OK, your <b>Level 18</b>, want to round-house kick me for
doing all that training with you, and can see Kreai up ahead. So
Go Get Him!</p>

<p><b>Boss Two - Kreai</b></p>

<p>Like with Xantan, make sure you have healed!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622164608im_/http://www.pinkpt.com/idnq/img/mon/boss/krei.gif" alt="Kreai"/></p>

<p><b>Tips</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Like with Xantan, Glacier Strike him. At Skill Level 2, Watch
the Carnage!</li>

<li>He can stun you, so keep Health high with potions.</li>

<li>Sometimes in the heat of battle, Fireball and Snowball are
more likely to hit at this stage then a normal Attack.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Profile</b>: He has <b>130 Health</b> on Normal. He is
<b>Level 15</b>. He can blast <b>Ice</b> and <b>Fire</b>, and can
<b>Stun</b> you.</p>

<p>He should be easy. Fortitude gives you some resistance against
his rarely used special attacks, and as you will find out, the
higher your level against a monster lower than your level, the
more likely you will hit. This also works backwards. The lower
your level compared to you opponent reduces your chance of a hit
(although it often is odd. Once I was Level 32 against a 37 Giant
Draconid, and even though I was squashed in there in the Battle
Screen, showing how big he was, I couldn't hit, just goes to show
how accuracy is important, not just how big the target is ;) ).
You should easily knock him out, and easily collect a <b class="key">Rotting Wooden Key</b> , your second Artifact, and
easily collect your <b>700NP</b> and <b>700 set Experience</b>
;).</p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b></p>

<p>Wow! You have completed <b>Dungeon One/Three</b>, and beat
<b>Two Bosses</b> into submission! Cool! You are <b>Level 18</b>,
and come on quite a bit I dare say! And you have Nearly
<b>Complete Potion Amounts</b> in Standard and possibly Weak .
You have grown <b>13 Levels</b> through this installment and you
have earned:</p>

<p>In this installment of the guide, you have earned: <b>4035
NP</b></p>

<p>Bringing your total NeoQuest NeoPoint Count To: <b>4285
NP</b></p>
