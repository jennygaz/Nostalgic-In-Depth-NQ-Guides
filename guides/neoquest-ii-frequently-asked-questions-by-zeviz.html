<a name="#1"></a><p><b>What level should I be before going to area ... ?</b></p>
<p>You should try to be at least the same level as monsters you are fighting. If you are a couple levels higher, you'll have very easy time. If you are a couple levels lower, you'll find yourself using a lot of potions. If you are more than 2 levels lower than the monsters you are fighting, you'll probably die soon.
<a name="#1a"></a><p><b>How do I tell the level of monsters I am fighting?</b></p>
<p>A level of a regular (non-boss) monster is probably = (his hitpoints - 10) / 5. So if the monster has 85 hitpoints, his level is (85 -10) / 5 = 15. This is just a guess, but it looks correct so far.
<br/>
<a name="#2"></a><p><b>What level should I be before fighting boss ... ?</b></p>
<p>If you can get to a boss without too much trouble, you should be able to handle him. If his guards are too tough for you, don't mess with the boss.</p><br/>
<a name="#3"></a><p><b>How do I heal?</b></p>
<ul><li>Rest at an inn. (This option is often the most expensive one.)</li>
<li>Drink a healing potion.</li>
<li>Level up.</li>
<li>Walk around. You gain a hitpoint with every step (several hitpoints on higher levels). NOTE: You can only get a few hitpoints by walking around between fights. After you gain about 10 hitpoints, you'll stop gaining them until next fight.</li></ul>
<br/>
<a name="#4"></a><p><b>How do I resurrect a dead party member?</b></p>
<ul><li>Use an Awakening Potion, or any other potion that has word "resurrection" in its description.</li>
<li>Rest at an inn.</li>
<li>Level up. (If a dead character gains a level, he is resurrected and brought up to full health.)</li></ul>
<br/>
<a name="#5"></a><p><b>What happens when I die?</b></p>
<p>In normal mode, you lose half your gold and are returned to the last inn where you have rested. All your characters are brought back to live and full health. So dying is not too bad if you aren't carrying too much cash.</p>
<a name="#5a"></a><p><b>How do I save my progress?</b></p>
<p>Rest at an inn. If you die, you'll be returned to that inn.</p><br/>

<a name="#6"></a><p><b>Where do I go next?</b></p>
<p>Talk to everybody in your current town. Somebody will tell you where to go. Or at least a general direction in which to go.</p>
<a name="#7"></a><p><b>I am lost in a maze. HELP!</b></p>
<p>There is a good way to get out of most mazes, the left hand rule: Put your left hand on a wall. Start walking along that wall and never let go of it. If you reach a dead end, turn around. Now you'll be following the opposite wall, heading out of the dead end. Eventually you will reach an exit, a boss, or the object of your search. This method has led me out of every maze in the game so far.</p><br/>

<a name="#8"></a><p><b>Should I put all my skill points into a few skills, or spread them out evenly?</b></p>
<p>The more points you put into a skill, the stronger it gets. For most skills you have to put in a lot of points before you get a good result. So the best strategy is to chose 2 or 3 main skills and put your points only into them, until you are satisfied with their level.</p><br/>

<a name="#9"></a><p><b>What's the highest level a skill can reach?</b></p>
<p>Level 15.</p><br/>

<a name="#10"></a><p><b>How long is the game?</b></p>
<p>You wouldn't want me to spoil a surprise for you, would you? :) Let's just say that the highest possible level for your character is 60. So comparing your current level to 60 should give you a clue about how far into the game you are.</p><br/><hr/><p>This Guide is currently rated <img src="../img/rating/star4.gif" style="vertical-align: middle" alt="3.8 stars"/>.
