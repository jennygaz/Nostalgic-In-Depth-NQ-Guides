<div id="content"><h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0">Choosing Skills</h1><p style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0">NeoQuest guide by Cyan Cloud. </p><p>Well, after completing Neoquest a number of times and surveying people from the Neoquest chat boards, I can't help but notice that people always say that the magic they specialise in are always the best, or so as they claim. I've got a friend who thinks Fire Magic is the best skill you can get, excluding Shock, that is. Personally, I think Fire Magic is not really effective as what he thinks. Think about it, after you look at my Magic and Skill review.</p>
<ul><li><b>Fire Magic:</b> Not very strong compared to the few others. Attacks only does a small amount of damage or needs to be casted, which I think is a waste of a turn as you have to do an attack that could be resisted whereas a normal attack would have a higher chance of hitting and does more damage.
<ul><li><i>Fire Weapons:</i> Only does a few points of damage, not very effective.</li>
<li><i>Firepower:</i> About the same as Fire Weapons.</li>
<li><i>Fireball:</i> A casting attack, wasting a turn again.</li>
<li><i>Wall of Flame:</i> Not a bad skill to have, considering it attacks your opponent when you're hit and you missed your opponent. But, wasting all those points on those other skills? You decide. I might not do it if I were in your shoes.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Ice Magic:</b> About the same as Fire Magic but a little bit worse as most of the skills there are more easily resisted than some Fire attacks.
<ul><li><i>Ice Weapons:</i> Same as Fire Weapons.</li>
<li>Heart of Ice: Only has a low percentage of 'freezing' your opponent.</li>
<li>Snowball: Another casting attack.</li>
<li>Glacier Strike: Does tons of damage and would be great if it wasn't resisted most of the time.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Shock Magic:</b> The best Magic you can have, or so as I claim(see, told you!). You don't have to waste a turn by casting anything and Shock Magic can be offensive and defensive as well.
<ul><li><i>Shock Weapons:</i> Stuns your opponents for a round or so, not a waste of skills as it's only the first skill and it's that much better than the first skills of Fire and Ice.</li>
<li><i>Disable:</i> Only does a few extra points of damage but the next skills are awesome(you need it to get to those other skills!).</li>
<li><i>Fortitude:</i> Boosts your resistance against Elemental blasters, stuns, poisoned blasts, etc. A smashing skill to get.</li>
<li><i>Shockwave:</i> My favorite skill(oops, I'm claiming again!). Stuns and does damage to your opponents, smashing, just smashing.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Spectral Magic:</b> Not a bad Magic, boosts up your defense and might reflect damage too!
<ul><li><i>Spectral Weapons:</i> Only works with a Spectral Weapon at hand. You need it for those other skills again.</li>
<li><i>Evasion:</i> Evades attacks. Not a bad skill.</li>
<li><i>Absorption:</i> Hope I've spelt it correctly! Another casting skill, but the skill which is awesome in my eyes is still one more point away(claiming again. Now you know what I mean?).</li>
<li><i>Reflex:</i> Smashing! It really does let your opponent's attack smash into themselves! I like seeing Jahbal hitting himself for 57 damage!</li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>Life Magic:</b> The basic unit. A definite must-have. Heals you while you're attacking and moving(you wouldn't want to end up without any potions left and losing to Xantan The Foul, right?). Why am I talking about him(or it)? We'll touch on that later.
<ul><li><i>Life Weapons:</i> Increases the value of potions. Not bad.</li>
<li><i>Field Medic:</i> Heals you when you're walkin' around.</li>
<li><i>Lifesteal:</i> Heals you but dosen't steal life from your opponents. Weird day, isn't it?</li>
<li><i>Resurrection:</i> Never gonna need if you're not gonna be defeated!</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b>Tip time:</b> Don't waste skill points on skills that rely on combat success by your opponent to work and as I mentioned earlier, try to avoid the skills which need to be cast, or wasting a turn, if you ask me. Take a positive attitude during combat, if played properly, those skills are never needed.</p>

<p>Well, that's the Skill Guide. Hope you liked it! My fingers are aching from all these typing. Too bad my computer won't allow me to post comments or questions... :cry: Oh, well. At lest I can see what you people posted. Until next time, I'll be mixing cucumbers with onions to create my very own Kitchen Stinkbomb! Yeah! Bye for now, chaps!</p>
