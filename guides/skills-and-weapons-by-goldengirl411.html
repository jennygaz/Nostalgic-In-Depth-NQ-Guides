<div id="content"><h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0">Skills And Weapons</h1><p style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0">NeoQuest guide by Goldengirl411. </p><p>So you are all excited about starting your new NeoQuest game.
You click on the start button, ready to fight any enemy that
crosses your path. But to your dismay, the next page that pops up
says something about Skill Points. Below, there are several
categories (Fire, Ice, Shock, Spectral, Life). Looks like Jahbal
is going to have to wait for now!</p>

<p>Instead of being impatient and clicking the first thing that
you see, wait a while and consider the choices. First of all, it
helps to learn more about each specific skill and what they
do.</p>

<p><b>Fire</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Fire Weapons - If you have a Fire Weapon and are using it
during combat, there is an increased chance that your attack will
hit your opponent for a few extra points of fire damage.</li>

<li>Firepower - This skill increases the damage that your
successful fire-based attacks cause to your opponent. It works
with any fire attacks, such as Wall of Flame, Fire Ball, and also
weapons with special fire powers and fire damage shields.</li>

<li>Fire Ball - Every few rounds, instead of the 'Attack' option
you may choose to 'Cast a Fire Ball'. This special attack blasts
your opponent with a ball of fire.</li>

<li>Wall of Flame - When your opponent hits you, they take
several points of fire damage from a wall of flames. This even
works when you are stunned!</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ice</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Ice Weapons - If you have an Ice Weapon and are using it
during combat, there is an increased chance that your attack will
hit your opponent for a few extra points of ice damage.</li>

<li>Heart of Ice - Your attack has a higher chance of freezing
your opponent and disabling them from attacking you that round.
However, special attacks are not affected.</li>

<li>Snowball - Every few rounds, instead of the 'Attack' option
you may choose to 'Cast a Snowball'. This special attack blasts
your opponent with a ball of snow.</li>

<li>Glacier Strike - This skill takes 3 rounds to use, and if you
use the normal 'Attack' option during that time then the Strike
is cancelled (special attacks like Snowball, Fire Ball etc. may
still be used). Although it takes a long time, it can do several
times normal damage!</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Shock</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Shock Weapons - If you have this skill, there is an increased
chance that your attack will stun your opponent for 1 round and
prevent them from attacking you during that round.</li>

<li>Disable - Your attacks have an increased chance of lowering
your opponent's defense ability.</li>

<li>Fortitude - You can resist some fire, ice and shock attacks
if you have this skill.</li>

<li>Shockwave - If you have this skill, occasionally you can stun
your opponent and cause several points of damage all at the same
time.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Spectral</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Spectral Weapons - Your defensive ability is increased if you
are using a Spectral Weapon.</li>

<li>Evasion - This skill basically lets you evade, or dodge, any
physical attacks.</li>

<li>Absorption - Every few rounds, instead of using the 'Attack'
option you can 'Cast Absorption'. This lets you absorb your
opponent's physical attack into a few health points for you.
However, if after 5 rounds you don't absorb their attack (as in
they keep on missing you) then the absorption wears off and you
are back to taking normal damage.</li>

<li>Reflex - Occasionally, your opponent's attack may be
reflected right back at them.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>Life Weapons - If you have this skill, you have a greater
chance to heal back lost health points as you walk around on the
map. Also, every skill point you put in this skill raises the
amount of points a healing potion would heal back by 1 (If you
have 4 points in Life Weapons, a Weak Healing Potion would heal
14 points of damage, but if you raise it to 5, then the potion
would heal back 15 points. If you have none in Life Weapons, then
the same potion would heal 10 points).</p>

<ul>
<li>Field Medic - You can regenerate health points during combat
if you have this skill.</li>

<li>Lifesteal - When you hit with a regular attack, part of the
damage you do is returned to you as health points.</li>

<li>Resurrection - If your health reaches zero, there is a chance
you will be returned to 50% of your full health as opposed to
dying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, now that you know a little bit about each skill, it is
time to actually pick the ones you like. To start off, you get 7
skill points. Although this may seem simple, the skills you
choose now are going to stick with you for the rest of the game.
Anyway, you can only spend a skill point in a skill if you have
more points in the previous one. For example, if your Firepower
skill is at 2, and your Fire Weapons skill is at 3, you can spend
one point in Firepower, but you can't spend another until you
improve Fire Weapons another point. To get any life skill, you
must first get the one in front of it.</p>

<p>The skills I would recommend everyone to try and get as many
points as possible in are Life, Shock and Spectral. However, this
is just my opinion and you don't have to follow it if you don't
want to. Now, whenever you gain a level in NeoQuest, you get one
more skill point to spend, so don't worry that much about getting
all the right skills. Good luck!</p>

<p>Okay, so you picked out all of your skills now, and you are
ready to fight. Wrong! There is one more thing you need to do
before you can enter Ancient Neopia and start on your quest. The
next page you are sent to when you accept your skill choices will
be about choosing your weapons. As you can see, there are 5
different colored wands: red, blue, yellow, black and white.
Again, put some thought into this. Well, I like purple, why isn't
that on there? Or green? Well, the answer is because each wand is
for each type of magic. Red = Fire, Blue = Ice, Yellow = Shock,
Black = Spectral and White = Life. Now then, to narrow it down a
little bit, my suggestion is to get a wand that does the same
type of damage as one of the skills you got. If you have your
skill points in Shock and Fire, there isn't really much of a
point in getting an Ice Wand.</p>

<p>The wand you choose now is not going to remain with you for
the rest of the game. This weapon does 3 points damage, the next
one does 6, then 10, 14 and finally 20. All of these will be
located around Ancient Neopia and you will have to fight to get
them or find the items to make them on your own. You do not have
to get wands of the same type of magic throughout the whole game!
If you got, say, a Spectral Wand this time, there is nothing
stopping you from getting a Life Wand next time.</p>

<p>Well then, good luck to all and enjoy your quest! Neomail me
