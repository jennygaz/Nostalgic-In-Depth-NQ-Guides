<div id="content"><h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0">Skills Guide</h1><p style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0">NeoQuest guide by iceysnowmanchamp. </p><p>Hi! Guten Tag! Bonjour! Whatever! Add a mushroom, turn into a
toad! However you say hello.</p>

<p>OK, when you start a game, you see a screen of Skills. WHAT?
You're not there? Oh, you need to know how to start a game
because none of the other guides have it! Heh heh... Just Click
on the games at the yellow column, and type N-e-o-q-u-e-s-t in
the search box. Now, click on the game Neoquest. You should see a
grey Neoquest Box. Click it, and press Start a new game in Normal
mode.</p>

<p>OK, so NOW you see the screen of skills. What!? You don't know
what skills are!? OH...! Whell, skills are, um... *skills* that
make your character more powerful. There are spheres of magic,
each of them is different and unique.<font color="blue">They are
the same!</font> No, they AREN'T! <font color="blue">YES THEY
ARE!</font> AHHHH!!!! BE QUIET!!!!</p>

<p>Well anyway, let me meditate to calm down. Wait for me. *you
wait a week. zzzz...* Hey! that snoring is loud! Anyway, The five
different spheres are Fire, Ice, Shock, Spectral and Life, as you
know (or don't know). Below are the skill branches and the
people's opinions on them. YOU CAN BELIEVE EITHER ONE!</p>

<table border="1" summary="Magic Descriptions" width="95%" align="center">
<tr>
<td class="row2"><b>Fire Magic</b> is the magic of fire (duh!).
It focuses only on doing more damage to your opponent.
<p>Opinion 1: This makes you do a lot of damage to the opponent,
and you will defeat them quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Opinion 2: Fire Magic is just not defensive enough, and does
few damage.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row1"><b>Ice magic</b> is the magic of ice (duh!)(OK
OK, I'll stop that). It mainly focuses on doing damage, little
bit of disabling.
<p>Opinion 1: Ice Magic's Glacier Strike does massive damage, and
the other skills are also good to do a lot of damage!</p>

<p>Opinion 2: Ice Magic's Glacier Strike takes too long to
charge, and the other skills are useless.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2"><b>Shock magic</b> is the magic of thunder
(like, obviously). It focuses lowering their defence and shocking
them so they can't attack (obviously).
<p>Opinion 1: Shock Rules! You can keep stunning them so that
they can't attack, and Fortitude also Rules!</p>

<p>Opinion 2: Shock Magic is not very helpful to do extra
damage.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row1"><b>Spectral Magic</b> is ghost magic *AHHH!! I'm
freaking out because I just discovered my neopet is a ghost!
AHHHH!!* (Well, I'm actually not sure if it's ghost magic or
color magic, as it spectral refers to both). Anyway, it focuses
on defence and counterattack.
<p>Opinion 1: Spectral Magic is too risky and unreliable.</p>

<p>Opninion 2: Spectral Magic helps you defend and it's VERY
GOOD! Reflex, absorption and evasion together are very good!</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2"><b>Life Magic</b> is the magic of life (no duh!
bet you didn't know that!)(well, it's not duh, it's no duh ;)).
It focuses only on healing.
<p>Opinion 1: Life Magic heals too little and is not reliable to
always heal you.</p>

<p>Opinion 2: Life Magic, combined with Spectral and Shock, make
a powerful and invincible team!</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Well, here is what I think of the skills. All the ratings are
out of 5, 5 being the best, 1 the worst. These are my opinions
and MY OPINION ONLY! You don't have to listen to it. (well again,
maybe you do)</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Magic Skills Descriptions and analysis" width="95%" align="center">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="row2"><b>Fire Magic</b>- Average
Rating=2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="150">Fire Weapons</td>
<td>This is not very useful to me, because, even at level 5, it
only does a few points of damage *faints*, which is not a lot
compared to your usual attack. It also gets resisted (NOOO!!) by
bosses a lot. In order for this to work better, you need to be
holding a Fire Weapon.
<p>Rating: 1</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Firepower</td>
<td>This skill is OK if you are investing in the Fire Sphere,
because it makes the fire attacks higher, and it's only the
second skill. Increasing this is better than increasing the skill
of your Fireball skill or your Wall of Flame skill, if you use
those, which I don't reccomend. But this is kind of no use if
using other types of skills.
<p>Rating: 3</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fireball</td>
<td>This skill is pretty good and powerful in the beginning, but
as it needs a lot of skill points in the future to make this do
higher damage, it is NOT recommended. It also gets resisted
(NOOO!!!) easily. Improving your Firepower skill is better, as it
increases Fireball, Fire Weapons AND Wall of flame, and Firepower
is only the second skill, so you don't need to use so many
points.
<p>Rating: 2</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Wall of Flame</td>
<td>This skill is also OK. It can be useful to hit with a few
points of damage each time your opponent damages you, even when
stunned. But this doesn't work with magic attacks *faints*, so
it's not very useful in the future. (yes, the future! the year
3000! How exciting!) Also like fireball, I would increase the
level of Firepower instead of this.
<p>Rating: 2</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2" colspan="2"><b>Ice Magic</b>- Average
Rating=3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ice Weapons</td>
<td>This is not very useful to me, because, even at level 5, it
only does a few points of damage (8 for me) *faints again*, which
is not a lot compared to your usual attack. But I give this a 2
because it does more damage than Fire Weapons (6 dmage), when I
used it and they were at the same level. It also gets resisted
(NOOO!!!) by bosses a lot. In order for this to work better, you
need to be holding an Ice Weapon. And it also hardly works
against bosses. It does come up pretty often though, 
<p>Rating: 2</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Heart of Ice</td>
<td>This skill is OK, although it doesn't block enemy magic
attacks, it does block their normal attacks. It also works better
on bosses then the skill, Shock Weapons. And at higher levels,
this skill works often, although it can be resisted (NOOO!!) 
<p>Rating: 3</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Snowball</td>
<td>Like fireball, this skill is pretty good and powerful in the
beginning, but as it needs a lot of skill points in the future to
make this do higher damage, it is NOT recommended. It is also
ressisted (NOOO!!!) more and more later in the game. But if you
are using Ice Magic, this skill could be useful for filling in
the extra turn for Glacier Strike.
<p>Rating: 3</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Glacier Strike</td>
<td>This skill is VERY GOOD, although you have to have 3 turns
before you launch it, you do MASSIVE damage. You do not need to
bring it's level so high, because the damage increases by the
LEVEL. The skill level decreases the chance of being resisted.
This skill does get resisted often (NOOO!!!), though, but with
disable, it is no problem. Also, it can make you take risks,
which is NOT good.
<p>Rating: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2" colspan="2"><b>Shock Magic</b>- Average
Rating=3.5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shock Weapons</td>
<td>This skill is better than Fire Weapons and Ice Weapons,
because it can cause stun. Although it still hardly works against
bosses *faints*, and can be resisted (NOOOO!!), sometimes, at
higher levels with Shockwave, you will almost be stunning every
round. 
<p>Rating: 2</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Disable</td>
<td>This skill is VERY effective. At higher levels, when casted,
it decreases an enemies resistance (defence) a lot. It works well
with Glacier Strike, although again, can be resisted. (NOOOO!!!)
<p>Rating: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fortitude</td>
<td>This skill is REALLY REALLY good. It lets you resist magic
attacks. And obviously, a skill that makes you resist can't be
resisted. (YEESSS!!) this skill is VITAL.
<p>Rating: 5</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shockwave</td>
<td>Although many people like this, I think that it needs too
much points for it to do a lot of extra damage *faints*. Although
the stun plus damage IS good. It can also be resisted (NOOO!!).
<p>Rating: 3</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2" colspan="2"><b>Spectral Magic</b>- Average
Rating=2.75</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Spectral Weapons</td>
<td>I have NO IDEA on how this skill works.*faints* <b>*in a
girlish voice*</b> I mean, like, don't waste your skill points
on, like, this totally useless thing, unless, like, you're using,
like spectral magic!
<p>Rating: 1</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Evasion</td>
<td>I love this skill. With high levels of this, combined with
Fortitude, is really effective as both magic and normal attacks'
chance of hitting you are reduced.
<p>Rating: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Absorption</td>
<td>Although this skill DOES neglate an attack and heals you
also, I think this is not very good, as it needs high levels to
heal a lot, and it also takes up a turn of your battle. It also
gets resisted (NOOO!!!) a lot, later in the game.
<p>Rating: 2</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Reflex</td>
<td>LOVE THIS SKILL! Neglects damage and reflects back at them.
It doesn't work very often though, but is very good in later
battles, particularly when the opponent does a lot of damage. 
<p>Rating: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2" colspan="2"><b>Life Magic</b>- Average
Rating=2.25</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Life Weapons</td>
<td>This skill is OK, as it increases the amount a healing potion
heals. But the healing when walking around doesn't happen very
often. Yay! I finally didn't faint! *faints of happiness*
<p>Rating: 3</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Field Medic</td>
<td>This skill is not very good, even at level 3, it only heals 2
HP. But it works well with Lifesteal, to make the amount of
healing more.
<p>Rating: 1</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lifesteal</td>
<td>This skill is pretty good! Healing when attacking is VERY
useful, works VERY often, heals VERY good, is VERY good. ;) I
recommend it. (then again, I don't like life) Anyway, this skill
is OK, but I think it heals kind of too little...
<p>Rating: 4</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ressurection</td>
<td>This skill IS THE MIRACLE!! You will be invincible and take
over the World!! MUHAHAHAHA!! 
<p>Rating: 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This is the the five skills that I like, if you're using my
guide (which, obviously, you will be)</p>

<ol>
<li>Fortitude<br/>
<b>What's the next one!</b></li>

<li>Evasion<br/>
<b>C'mon! We want to know!</b></li>

<li>Reflex<br/>
<b>Just tell us!</b></li>

<li>Glacier Strike<br/>
<b>AHH!!! *you faint of suspense*</b></li>

<li>Disable (Disable and Glacier Strike are like a pair, you
can't have one without the other ;))</li>
</ol>

<p><b><u>Tips for Spending Skills</u></b>
<p>Use points on skills based on what you need. For example, you're
level 11 and still haven't got any points in Shock, and you're
going to have to beat Kreai. Better spend a few points in
Fortitude. And you don't have to spend points in a skill that you
don't want. For example, you really want a high level Fortitude,
but only have 6 levels left until the next boss. My advice: don't
spend a lot of points on Shockwave YET. Put a point on Shock
Weapons, Disable, Fortitude, Shock Weapons, Disable, Fortitude,
and after you beat Kreai you can put points in Shockwave.</p>

<p>Well, hope this guide was well done. Not too rare, not too
well done... just the way you like it. (Why am I comparing guides
to a steak? I really don't know) If it is, tell hunter I'm a
perfect proofreader. ;)</p>

<p>Bye! *Waves to the crowd as they throw roses, ignoring the
tomatoes thrown*</p>
