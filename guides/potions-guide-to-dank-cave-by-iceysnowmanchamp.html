<div id="content"><h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0">Potions Guide To Dank Cave</h1><p style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0">NeoQuest guide by iceysnowmanchamp. </p><p>So, you are now here to learn about the most deadliest liquid
that you could drink! Poison! Yes, it damages you gradually, and
you will get sent back to Neopia City... MUHAHAHA *cackles
loudly*. <span class="hide">(like a witch!)</span></p>

<p>Eh... not really... anyway, I'm here to talk about potions.
What are they? Potions are liquids that heal you. They taste
like... this:</p>

<p>So never ever try to drink potions!</p>

<p><b>About Potions</b></p>

<p>Well, potions are liquids that heal you. That amount that the
potion heals, will increase by one for each point in your life
weapons skill... This guide assumes you have few points on life
weapons. Potions are hardly needed when you have lots of points
in the life tree-but are needed more in the ice and fire trees.
<i>Because it burns and freezes it up?</i> No,
because you would have less defence concentrated when using those
trees.</p>

<p><b>Using Potions</b></p>

<p>(getting up)... um... Potions can be used at 2 times:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>At battle</b>--In battle, use the stronger ones to heal,
don't waste the smaller ones.</li>

<li><b>When Exploring</b>--When exploring, use the weaker ones,
often multiples of them, to save the stronger ones for
battle.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Before Dank Cave</b></p>

<p>You are introduced to the Weak Healing Potion:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="500" align="center" summary="Weak Healing Potion">
<tr>
<th rowspan="3">Weak Healing
Potion</td>
<td class="row2">Heals: 10 HP (increase 1 for each point in life weapons)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row1">Location and Rarity: Very Common in the Dank Cave and the
Plains of Neopia. Uncommon in the jungle ruins (found on the
first floor, second)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="row2">Usage: Bit useful in the beginning, not really useful later.
Mainly used when exploring.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Before the Dank Cave, I would try to use all my potions at
once, not going for more.</p>

<p>Ehh... no, just hunt around, and when you have few HP, just
SNEAK back to Neopia City to heal from Boraxis the healer. Try
not to use a lot of potions, to save them for later, when you are
in the Dank Cave.</p>

<p><b>Dank Cave-Potions</b></p>

<p><b>Level 1</b>- At level 1, the monsters are easy, but if you
ever get down to only 10 HP or less, use a weak healing potion
just in case, even if your opponent is almost dying. I have lots
of experience from this, because the first time I played, I kept
taking risks and I died! DONT TAKE RISKS!!</p>

<p><b>Level 2</b>- The monsters are bit harder here, but they are
not a threat. Only watch out for the broken skeletons, which can
deal higher damage than most of the other monsters.</p>

<p><b>Level 3</b>- There are burned skeletons and frozen
skeletons here. Try not to start a fight with less than 20 HP,
because you'll find yourself keep having to use potions.</p>

<p><b>Levl 4</b>- Watch out for the metal devourers, who can
poison you and cause a lot of damage. In the metal devourer zone,
have at least 25 HP before fighting one. If you have been
poisoned and your HP is less than 10, use a standard healing
potion, because if you use a weak one, it will damage you again,
and you'll have to use another potion. The cave ogres can also
stun you for one round, so try to have at least 25 HP for that
too. When you're out of the metal devourer-cave ogre zone, the
skeletal guards are not that much of a threat, but try to have at
least 20 HP before fighting them anyways.</p>

<p>You are introduced to the Standard Healing Potion:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="500" align="center" summary="Standard Healing Potion">
<tr>
<th rowspan="3">Standard Healing Potion</th>
<td class="row1">Heals: 30 HP (increase 1 for each point in life weapons)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="row2">Location and Rarity: Found on the dank cave (lv. 4), but
uncommon, and found of dungeons of jungle ruins lv. 1, 2, and
3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="row1">Usage: Is OK, used mainly in battle at the Dank Cave (against
metal devourers and Xantan) and Jungle Ruins (dungeons-lv. 1 and
2). Also used when exploring in Jungle Ruins (dungeon-Gors and
lv.3)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Xantan</b>- When having to use potions against Xantan, use
the Standard Healing Potions, DO NOT waste your weak healing
potions on him. Try to also keep your HP above 20 because this
overgrown mud pile can do a fireblast, which does 20 damage. If
you don't have enough potions, just flee and go back to the first
level and come back. I'll wait... *yawn*</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="500" align="center" summary="Potion/HP chart">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><b>HP left</b></td>
<td bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><b>USE:</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>less than 21</td>
<td>Standard Healing Potion</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>21-31</td>
<td>May use Standard Healing Potion</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>More than 31</td>
<td>Don't use any healing potions</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Oh... did I fall asleep? Oh well, look out for my next guide,
potions in the Jungle Ruins, and my Skills and Dank Cave guide
Coming Soon.</p>
