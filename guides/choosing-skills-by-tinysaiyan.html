Normal mode, you are presented with a screen listing various
abilities. &quot;WOW!&quot; you might think. &quot;I gotta have
some of these!&quot; But whoa there Skippy, this is something
that needs to be thought out since it will affect how you play
NeoQuest. Let&#39;s have a look at the different skill areas.</p>

<p><b>Fire Magic</b></p>

<p>This is the magic of violence and destruction, harnessing the
powers of flame to burn your opponents down where they stand.
Fire Magic focuses entirely on causing offensive damage.</p>

<p><b>Ice Magic</b></p>

<p>This is the magic of freezing and slowing, bringing the forces
of frost to bear on your opponents in order to strike them and
slow them down. Ice Magic focuses mostly on causing damage, with
some disabling ability.</p>

<p><b>Shock Magic</b></p>

<p>This is the magic of stunning and disabling, using the power
of lightning to disable and confuse your opponents. Shock Magic
focuses on stunning and disabling opponents, with some
defence.</p>

<p><b>Spectral Magic</b></p>

<p>This is the magic of defence and protection, increasing your
ability to avoid taking damage and mitigating the damage that you
do take. Spectral Magic focuses on defence, with some
counterattack.</p>

<p><b>Life Magic</b></p>

<p>This is the magic of regrowth and healing, continuing the
cycle of life as you make your way through the world. Life Magic
focuses entirely on healing.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>Sound good? You bet! But before you go clicking everything at
random and spending skill points here, there and everywhere, you
need to take what kind of a battler you are into consideration.
&quot;Huh?&quot; you say?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend that you&#39;re a fierce warrior who enjoys
watching various creatures cower in your shadow. It may not be
such a wise idea to choose Spectral Magic, since this will make
you avoid and defend. However, Fire Magic will serve you well.
Get the general idea?</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve taken that in, we still have to be rational
about those skill points. You may love the idea of burning your
rivals to a cinder, but what if your HP plummets and you&#39;re
conserving your Healing Potions, hmm? Now this is just my
opinion, but Life Magic is a LIFESAVER (no pun intended,
seriously). Even if you only spend 3 Skill Points upgrading
these, you&#39;ll still have 4 points to spend in Fire. This
balances it out and will help you along your way.</p>

<p>Now that this is over and done with, you&#39;ll be asked to
select a starting weapon. Don&#39;t choose blue because it&#39;s
your favourite colour when you&#39;ve spent most of your Skill
Points in Fire! Think about it! Remember that if you suddenly
become bored with your wand, you can always change it to a
different element later.</p>

<p>On a final note, as you progress through the game, for each
time you level up you gain a Skill Point to spend in the skill of
your choice. You only get one, so choose it wisely. Bored of
Fire? Why not try Ice!? Want to evade? Spectral might be
good.</p>
