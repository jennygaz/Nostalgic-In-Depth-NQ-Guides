past, you come to find out that you must now choose skills. You
start off with 7 skill points and alot of skill options in front
of you. The first thing to do is not to start clicking, but to
start thinking. These skills determine your fighting style and
progress. You will recieve an additional skill point for every
level you raise and only one. This means that getting all the
skills is just about impossible. Therefore, you must start by
knowing what each skill does.</p>

<table width="570" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" summary="Skill Descriptions" border="1">
<tr>
<th>Skill Descriptions</th>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><br/>
<b>Fire</b><br/>
<br/>
Fire Weapons - (Level 1) - If you have a Fire Weapon and are
using it during combat, there is an increased chance that your
attack will hit your opponent for a few extra points of fire
damage. (note: better with Fire Wand armed, but not needed to
work)<br/>
<br/>
Firepower - (Level 2) - This skill increases the damage that your
successful fire-based attacks cause to your opponent. It works
with any fire attacks, such as Wall of Flame, Fire Ball, and also
weapons with special fire powers and fire damage shields.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Ball - (Level 3) - Every few rounds, instead of the 'Attack'
option you may choose to 'Cast a Fire Ball'. This special attack
blasts your opponent with a ball of fire.<br/>
<br/>
Wall of Flame - (Level 4) - When your opponent hits you, they
take several points of fire damage from a wall of flames. (note:
this skill still works when you are stunned)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row2">
<td><b>Ice</b><br/>
<br/>
Ice Weapons - (Level 1) - If you have an Ice Weapon and are using
it during combat, there is an increased chance that your attack
will hit your opponent for a few extra points of ice damage.
(note: better with Ice Wand armed, but not needed to work)<br/>
<br/>
Heart of Ice - (Level 2) - Your attack has a higher chance of
freezing your opponent and disabling them from attacking you that
round. However, special attacks are not affected.<br/>
<br/>
Snowball - (Level 3) - Every few rounds, instead of the 'Attack'
option you may choose to 'Cast a Snowball'. This special attack
blasts your opponent with a ball of snow.<br/>
<br/>
Glacier Strike - (Level 4) - This skill takes 3 rounds to use,
and if you use the normal 'Attack' option during that time then
the Strike is cancelled (special attacks like Snowball, Fire Ball
etc. may still be used). Although it takes a long time, it can do
several times normal damage!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><b>Shock</b><br/>
<br/>
Shock Weapons - (Level 1) - If you have this skill, there is an
increased chance that your attack will stun your opponent for 1
round and prevent them from attacking you during that round.
(note: this is not effective wiothout arming a Shock Wand)<br/>
<br/>
Disable - (Level 2) - Your attacks have an increased chance of
lowering your opponent's defense ability. (note: I don't think
this works well)<br/>
<br/>
Fortitude - (Level 3) - You can resist some fire, ice and shock
attacks if you have this skill.<br/>
<br/>
Shockwave - (Level 4) - If you have this skill, occasionally you
can stun your opponent and cause several points of damage all at
the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row2">
<td><b>Spectral</b><br/>
<br/>
Spectral Weapons - (Level 1) - Your defensive ability is
increased if you are using a Spectral Weapon.(note: this is not
effective without arming a Spectral Wand)<br/>
<br/>
Evasion - (Level 2) - This skill basically lets you evade, or
dodge, any physical attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Absorption - (Level 3) - Every few rounds, instead of using the
'Attack' option you can 'Cast Absorption'. This lets you absorb
your opponent's physical attack into a few health points for you.
However, if after 5 rounds you don't absorb their attack (as in
they keep on missing you) then the absorption wears off and you
are back to taking normal damage.<br/>
<br/>
Reflex - (Level 4) - Occasionally, your opponent's attack may be
reflected right back at them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><b>Life</b><br/>
<br/>
Life Weapons - (Level 1) - If you have this skill, you have a
greater chance to heal back lost health points as you walk around
on the map. (note: this ability increases the healing power of
your potions by one hp for every skill point sunk into Life
Weapons and healing while walking will not work without a Life
Wand armed)<br/>
<br/>
Field Medic - (Level 2) - You can regenerate health points during
combat if you have this skill. (note: the healing is about half
the skill points used and this works when you are stunned)<br/>
<br/>
Lifesteal - (Level 3) - When you hit with a regular attack, part
of the damage you do is returned to you as health points. (note:
the healing power is one hp for every skill point sunk into
Lifesteal)<br/>
<br/>
Resurrection - (Level 4) - If your health reaches zero, there is
a chance you will be returned to 50% of your full health as
opposed to dying. (note: please don't die)<br/>
<br/>

<p>Now that you understand each of the available skills and the
elements they are associated with, lets understand how to pick
them. The first thing to keep in mind is that you can't start
with the highest level ability. You must first invest in the
abilities below it in the same elemental group in order to get
it. For example: in order to put one skill point into the
Shockwave skill you must first have one skill point in Shock
Weapons, Disable, and Fortitude each. The trick is to find the
skill you really want and then understand the skills you need
before it, or rather the investment needed. Now once you have got
the ability you want, you need to invest in the lower abilities
again in order to raise it. NO skill can be higher in skill
points then the skill that is under it and in the same element
group. That is really the only rule.</p>

<p>Now the question is what skills do I choose for my character.
This is a good question to ask since the answer to it effects how
your little Lupe developes. The answer is really what fits your
personality or what fits your fighting preferance. Some say that
if you are a fighter, then choose ice and fire cause the skills
in it have the high damage. Another is that if you like to have
high defense, then develope the Spectral and Life Skills. The
thinking behind this is that you shouldn't spread yourself out to
thin or else you become a jack of all trades, while a master of
none. And rightly you should decide early in the game or even
from the very start what skills you should go for. I, however, do
have an alturnative to the "two maybe three element" model that
most use.</p>

<p>One aspect that I find lacking in most guides about Neoquest
skills is that they neglect to show that you don't have to use
all of an element and thus all of its skills. The key thing to
remember is that in order to get a particular ability you need
only get the abilities before and you never have to touch the
ones after it. Granted the coolest sounding skills are on the top
of the chain, it still doesn't mean that they are the best for
you or the most compatible with your interest and other
abilities. I have outlined here that by picking and choosing
abilities you can get a solid group of skills for less or equal
to the hundred skill points (the skill points needed to maximize
two whole element groups). I have listed here the best for a
curtain theme, but you may choose your own sort of strategy that
involves other skills.</p>

<th>Skill / Character Combinations</th>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><br/>
<b>Best Spell Caster</b><br/>
<br/>
A true wizard type character doesn't use his weapon often. There
is in Neoquests a number of alternatives to attacking, such as
the casting of spells. The four spells of Neoquests are:<br/>
<br/>
-Fire Ball (Fire Level 3)<br/>
-Snow Ball (Ice Level 3)<br/>
-Glacier Strike (Ice Level 4)<br/>
-Absorption (Spectral Level 3)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 10 skill points to start and a
maximum of 100 to obtain fully. 30 Fire (30%): 40 Ice (40%): 30
Spectral (30%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: Allows the character an option to attack even if
they are frozen yet not stunned. It is also the best combo for
promoting the Glacier Strike attack since you have three other
spells to use that do not stop the attack from charging. Plus
healing without healing items is possible with the Absorption
Spell.<br/>
Extras: Unintended Advantages include high levels of damage from
the fire and ice weapon skills that don't need a wand to have an
effect. Plus the ability to freeze your opponent and have a
higher level of defense if you wish.<br/>
Wand Choice: I would choose the spectral wand since without it
you miss the extra defense advantage. While the other two
weapon-based abilities happen anyway, just with a lower rate is
all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row2">
<td><b>Best Stunner</b><br/>
<br/>
If you want to be the type of person that stops his/her opponents
in their tracks then this combo is for you. Your basic attack in
this case adds to the chance of getting free blows without any
fear of penalty. There are three stopping skills to
consider:<br/>
<br/>
-Heart Of Ice (Ice Level 2)<br/>
-Shock Weapons (Shock Level 1)<br/>
-Shock Wave (Shock Level 4)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 6 skill points to start and a
maximum of 60 to obtain fully. 20 Ice (33%): 40 Shock (67%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: Gives you a chance to catch up in any battle.
Between misses, being frozen, being stunned, and the extra damage
that Shock Wave delivers, your opponent will often times never
get to attack you. The best part is when your enemy is stopped
for multiple rounds which is best achieved with both shock
abilities. But remember your only healing option is
potions.<br/>
Extras: Unintended Advantages is that you not only deliver the
most powerful stuns, but you also get some immunity from them as
well. The fact that you lower your enemy's defense is okay, but I
never saw it make a difference. The Ice weapons ability also
helps cause more damage and thus making for lesser rounds in
battle.<br/>
Wand Choice: I would choose the Shock wand since it is a part of
you shock success and since you get the ice weapons advantage
anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><b>Best Defender</b><br/>
<br/>
If you like to be the type of guy who can stand up to powerful
attacks and laugh about it (or you duck into the fetal position
anytime a monster comes by). Then this combo is for you. The five
skills that stop damage are:<br/>
<br/>
-Fortitude (Shock Level 3)<br/>
-Spectral Weapon (Spectral Level 1)<br/>
-Evasion (Spectral Level 2)<br/>
-Absorption (Spectral Level 3)<br/>
-Reflex (Spectral Level 4)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 7 skill points to start and a
maximum of 70 to obtain fully. 30 Shock (43%): 40 Spectral
(57%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: Every skill here has the ability to stop or
diminish the damage you take. The shock ability can often stop
ice or fire damage that can amount to double or triple digits if
not blocked. Spectral Weapons cuts down the normal damage and
Evasion lets you block it completely. The other two abilities
block regular damage and also uses the energy to your advantage
that includes healing or attacking.<br/>
Extras: Not a whole lot is unintended as an advantage other then
the ability to shock, which is only useful with a shock wand. And
the cool reversal of lowering your opponents defense while you
raise yours (too bad I don't think it helps a whole lot).<br/>
Wand Choice: You could get the shock wand and make the shock
weapons skill useful, but not arming the spectral wand would
defeat the idea of this combo as the best defender.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row2">
<td><b>Best Healer</b><br/>
<br/>
There are many of you out in old Neopia that think your potions
are collector items and maybe you even want to put them in that
gallery of yours. Well this is the best combo for healing without
help from items. The five abilities best for this is:<br/>
<br/>
-Absorption (Spectral Level 3)<br/>
-Life Weapons (Life Level 1)<br/>
-Field Medic (Life Level 2)<br/>
-Life Steal (Life Level 3)<br/>
-Resurrection (Life Level 4)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 7 skill points to start and a
maximum of 70 to obtain fully. 30 Spectral (43%): 40 Life
(57%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: With every step and every swing you gain slowly,
but surely, every lost hp you have. Life steal will earn you a hp
for every skill point used on it (and of course when it works),
but you need to attack to use it. The Field medic raises your
shock protection since it can work even if you can't move, yet at
only half the amount hp compared to life steal. And absorption is
just good to use. Resurrection counts as a healing skill but I
think the point is to keep your hp from getting below zero in the
first place. I sometimes upgrade that last.<br/>
Extras: The real advantage is that you save yourself some damage
with the Evasion skill by blocking all of a physical attack. The
spectral Weapons isn't useful since life weapons is more fitting.
Oh, and if you were to use your potions, they get a bonus from
the life weapons skill of up to 10 hp each (one for every skill
point spent).<br/>
Wand Choice: If you feel a little protection is better then the
healing you get outside battle is better, then put on a spectral
wand. But the best healer always wears a life wand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row1">
<td><b>Best Anti-Stun</b><br/>
<br/>
Do you hate being stunned? If you desire to be almost unaffected
by this nasty trick then this is the combo I would try. It may
not allow you to blast your opponent away with a one thousand
point blow, but it won't make your move completely useless
either. Your three key skills are:<br/>
<br/>
-Wall of Flame (Fire Level 4)<br/>
-Fortitude (Shock Level 3)<br/>
-Field Medic (Life Level 2)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 9 skill points to start and a
maximum of 90 to obtain fully. 40 Fire (44%): 30 Shock (33%): 20
Life (22%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: The best part of this strategy is the healing
your able to receive when you're stunned. It may not be
spectacular, but it does make you feel better. If the monster
also lands a physical blow you can bet that Wall of Fire will act
as your revenge. Fortitude can stop fire and ice damage that
might occur while stunned. The best part is that fortitude keeps
you from being stunned in the first place.<br/>
Extras: The many abilities involved don't just work well in the
context of being stunned, but also in regular battle. Disable is
supposed to bring down the defense and absorption is another way
to heal. The best Extra is the three fire skills that let you do
extra damage when not stunned and a chance to damage when frozen
too. But as far as the weapons skills are concerned, its your
choice as to which you like, just remember that fire is the only
one out of the three that is somewhat useful without the matching
weapon.<br/>
Wand Choice: I would take the shock wand since I think its cool
that the anti-stun Combo also stuns in reverse. But you could
also pick the life or fire wand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="row2">
<td><b>Most Damage</b><br/>
<br/>
If your style is to be the cause of most pain and suffering, then
I would make this Combo your first choice. It presents damage on
the level of fire, ice and physical. I picked out five main
skills that attribute to high damage on regular blows that
are:<br/>
<br/>
-Fire Weapons (Fire Level 1)<br/>
-Firepower (Fire Level 2)<br/>
-Ice Weapons (Ice Level 1)<br/>
-Disable (Shock Level 2)<br/>
-Shockwave (Shock Level 4)<br/>
<br/>
This Combo adds to a minimum of 7 skill points to start and a
maximum of 70 to obtain fully. 20 Fire (29%): 10 Ice (14%): 40
Shock (57%)<br/>
<br/>
Main Advantages: Fire Weapons, Ice Weapons and Shockwave each
cause damage that is independent of your attack yet requires you
to choose the attack option. The best part is that the damage may
occur even when you miss and that enemy defense is also lowered
at times. When most successful, this attack makes one hit kills a
common occurrence. Plus Firepower is key to making the fire
portion of your attack better.<br/>
Extras: The best unintended extra is that Shockwave not only
causes good damage, but also stuns your prey. You also get
protection from fire, ice and stun attacks as well as possibly
deliver stuns on regular blows.<br/>
Wand Choice: I would choose fire first and ice second cause
either one helps optimize the damage a bit further.<br/>
<br/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that some of these can be
combined or enhanced with the addition of a skill one or two
levels ahead. For example if you take the Most Damage category
and raise the Ice ability by one level (10 skill points) you also
get the Best Stunner for 80 points.</p>

<p>In either case, just pick whatever suits you best. Just don't
pick too many and keep in mind that some skills take more to get
then others. Kick some butt and enjoy Neoquest.</p><br/><hr/><p>This Guide is currently rated <img src="../img/rating/star4.gif" style="vertical-align: middle" alt="3.9 stars"/>.
