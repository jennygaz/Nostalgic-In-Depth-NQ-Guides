<div id="content"><h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0">How to own a NeoQuest II boss fight</h1><p style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0">NeoQuest II guide by philodice. </p><p>Somewhere around level 25 or so, I came to a realization of how to never
lose a battle.  Simply put, the boss can't hit you if it is never her turn.
So I started over.  I had made some poor choices in skills and that would
not help me with this new strategy.</p>
<p>I built up Rohane's battle damage increase, critical hits and innate melee
speed evenly,
maxing out at 15 each in those categories, so now at level 54 he is moving
something like insane speed.  Then only I started spending on innate magic
resistance and stunning strikes.  This means he never gets stunned, and has
a large chance of stunning his opponent.  I spent no points on anything
else.</p>
<p>When you get Mipsy, the game gives you plenty of points to spend in order to
max out direct damage.  Not group damage, just direct damage.  At that level
most opponents will take only one shot from Mipsy and the fight is over.  So
since she has the big gun, make her move really, really fast.  Innate
casting haste looks good, but spend evenly on group haste and innate haste
so that all your party members get that speed bonus.  If you have problems
keeping Mipsy alive, spend some on innate damage resistance as well.  I
spent no points on damage shields.  Remember, the point is to kill them
before they hit you.</p>
<p>Talinia was my first character to have too many skills to choose from.  I
decided to buy group damage, because she has the ability to stun all
opponents.  So I maxed out her damage increase, maxed out her group damage
skill, then spent evenly on innate battle speed, magic resistance and
stunning strikes.</p>
<p>Velm has too many wuss skills for me.  I maxed out the Celestial Hammer
because it stuns, and I maxed out group healing.  I just think that
individual healing is a waste of time!  I spent no points on that skill at
all.  I didn't want Velm to be fast, because he would just get in the way of
Mipsy's big gun and Rohane's ridiculously huge sword, so I spent the rest in
innate damage resistance and group shielding.  The group shield is cool
because it helps Rohane resist being stunned, mesmerized or distracted by
shiny objects.</p>
<p>So, on to the battle of the Devilpuss.
Step one, hit the boss with the strongest slowing potion you have.  At this
point, I had the 70% slowing potion.</p>
<p>Step two, have Mipsy cast group haste.  Combining group haste, the innate
haste points I spent and the slowing potion, your party is moving at extreme
lightning speed compared to the poor, helpless Devilpuss.</p>
<p>Step Three, Rohane hits the Boss, and stuns it for several seconds.  Talinia
hits the Boss, and stuns it for several seconds.  Velm Celestial Hammers the
Boss, and stuns it for several seconds.  Mipsy fries the Boss.  Repeat.
Step Four, since the Devlipuss has spent the entire battle stunned or in a
coma, well, there is no step four.</p><br/>
