<p>As you probably already know, in NeoQuest, you play a white
Lupe, and you have to fight your way through the hoards of
monsters, and have to defeat how ever is doing this to Ancient
Neopia, and then blast them off a very high balcony ;) . Whenever
you fight a monster, if you win, you get <b>experience</b>. When
you get enough experience, you gain a <b>Level</b>. When you gain
a level, your maximum health increases by five points, youget
your health upped from wherever to maximum, and also you gain a
valuable thing indeed, a <b>Skill Point</b>! Skill Points are
used to give yourself <b>Skills</b>, and also make existing
Skills stronger. Skills are almost a necessity if you wish to win
NeoQuest.</p>

<p>Each skill comes from one of the <b>Five Spheres</b>, and each
skill has different powers.</p>

<p>You get <b>Seven Skill Points</b> when you start the game for
you to use. I suggest that you get the first three skills in the
<font color="#ff0000">Fire</font> Skill Tree and the <font color="#0000ff">Ice</font> Skill Tree, and you spend your last
point on the first in the <font color="brown">Life</font> Skill
Tree.<br/>
This will make your attacks stronger, give you special things to
cast, and make Healing Potions more effective, by one health
point per skill level! Then when you gain more levels, use the
points to finish the <font color="#ff0000">Fire</font> Tree and
the Ice Tree, then complete the rest, starting with the <font color="#A52A2A">Life</font> Tree, then <font color="#00ff00">Spectral</font> followed with <font color="#ffff00">Shock</font>. Remember, you can only increase
skill level of a skill if the previous skill level is higher then
the one you want to increase, but the beginning Skills can be
raised without raising any other skill, i.e., Ice Weapons Skill
Level is 2, but <font color="#0000ff">Heart of Ice</font> is 0.
<font color="#0000ff">Heart of Ice</font> is after <font color="#0000ff">Ice Weapons</font>, and can be increased twice;
to Skill Level 2, but not again until Ice Weapons is increased
again. Ice Weapons can be increased without increasing another
skill first, as it is the first skill of the tree. The maximum
skill level for <b>any</b> skill is 10.</p>

<p>Below is a table of skills, and my evaluation of each
skill.</p>

<p><b>Choosing a Weapon</b></p>

<p>You also get a free weapon when you start, it is a basic
damage three wand, and none have special abilities, so it doesn't
matter which one you get. Personally, I would get the <font color="#0000ff">Blue</font> Wand, purely because <font color="#0000ff">Blue's</font> my favorite colour!</p>

<p><b>Neopia City</b></p>

<p>When you have got your wand, you will be transported to Neopia
City. If you don't know how to navigate, try my
soon-to-be-released-guide (hopefully), Part 0, How to Use
NeoQuest! Look around the city and talk to the Non Player
Characters, but don't leave the city let! I'll wait...</p>

<p>Back Already? Good. Now, <b>Sneaking</b>, head East (Right)
until you are inside a ring of hills called The Training Ground.
<b>Hunt</b> around and around and fight all the monsters you
find. They're Imps, <b>Ice Imps</b> and <b>Fire Imps</b>. They
shouldn't be to difficult to beat, and be sure to collect the
<b>Weak Healing Potion</b>'s, and the all other items they carry.
Weak Healing Potions heal 10 default health, and with your <font color="#A52A2A">Life</font> Weapons Point, 11!</p>

<p>Remember, <b>Save Potions</b>, use <b>Borax the Healer</b> in
Neopia City, he will heal you to maximum health.</p>

<p>At <b>Level</b> <b>3</b> hunt south and west of Neopia City,
collecting <b>Glowing Stones</b> and all the other things that
the plains monsters carry, things like <b>Plains Lupes</b> and
<b>Black Bearogs</b>, carry. Although these are stronger
monsters, the experience is higher than the imps and you'll find
them by this level not too difficult. Remember to spend your
skill points correctly!</p>

<p>By the time you're <b>Level 5</b>, (and it shouldn't be long
because leveling up is easy at the beginning stages) your skills
will be one in all of the <font color="#ff0000">Fire</font> Magic
and the Ice Magic tree's, and one in the first three of the <font color="#A52A2A">Life</font> Magic tree.</p>

<p>Also, by then you should have collected the items in at least
one set of the items in the table below:</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Armor Requirements">
<tr>
<th>Set One</th>
<th>Set Two</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="right" width="50%">A Blue Thread</td>
<td width="50%">A Hunk of Metal</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="right" width="50%">A Plains Lupe Pelt</td>
<td width="50%">A Small Yellow Gem</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="right" width="50%">A Glowing Stone</td>
<td width="50%">A Glowing Stone</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Once you have one of the sets, head into Neopia city to get
your basic, defense 3 <b>amour</b>! Whoopee! Now then, talk to
Moraxis, give him one of the sets of items and the Scorchio will
make you your armour!<br/>
<b>Set One</b> makes you a set of <b>Cloth Robes</b>, and <b>Set
Two</b> makes you a <b>Energy Shield</b>. Neither have special
powers, so you can get either, but their is no point getting two,
as there is no difference between them at all, it is just a waste
of items, mainly Glowing Stones.</p>

<p><b><font size="5">Congratulations!</font></b></p>

<p>You have successfully trained up, at least, <b>four</b>
levels, and have a <b>damage 3 wand</b>, and you are wearing
either a <b>Cloth Robe</b> or bearing a <b>Energy Shield</b>,
which have a <b>defense of three</b>. You are, I repeat,
<b>are</b> ready for the <b>Dank Caves</b>! Don't go there yet!
Read the next part of my guide, <i>"Hills of Jub and Dank Cave,
with Weapon and Armour upgrades!"</i> with the bonus section,
<i>"Grarrl Peninsula, Grarrl Jungle, and Part One of.... The
Jungle Ruins!"</i> first!</p>

<table summary="Prize Summary So Far" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="small">In this installment of the guide, you have
earned:</td>
<td><b>250 NP</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="small">Bringing your total NeoQuest NeoPoint Count
To:</td>
<td><b>250 NP</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><i>If you think that is too little, just wait for later
levels, NP will poor in by thoasands!</i></p>

<p>You should have around 20/30 Weak Healing Potions, at least,
and if you don't, get out there and fight, Fight, and Fight!
until you do! You should have around 10 Glowing stones, but if
you don't you can get on with about six tight... oh, and a load
of misc. items! If you don't have round that many Glowing Stones,
then get out there and fight, Fight and Fight! until you do,
(again!) Now go! Order a pizza, e-mail your friends, do your
geography homework-And that reminds me...</p>
